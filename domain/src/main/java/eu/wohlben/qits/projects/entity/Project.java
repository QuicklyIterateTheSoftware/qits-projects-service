/**
 * The aggregate root: <b>one application that starts as a single wrapper repository and grows into
 * a polyrepository</b>. Its {@link #repositories} are the parts of that single app — microservices,
 * shared libraries, extracted fixtures — curated together by one maintainer, <b>not</b> an
 * aggregation of arbitrary third-party repos. This framing is load-bearing when reasoning about the
 * submodule/workspace code (name collisions within a project are the maintainer's own choice;
 * {@code origin} is a backup, not an authority): see the package doc ({@link
 * eu.wohlben.qits.projects}) and {@code docs/guides/project-model.md}.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}.</b> Every project row is written on a request thread — {@code
 * ProjectService.create}, reached from {@code ProjectController} or from the MCP tool surface — so
 * the {@code CausationStamp} listener reads the scope the {@code X-Qits-Causation-Id} filter
 * restored and the column records what asked for the project. A browser create carries no header
 * and the row is rootless, which is the honest answer rather than a missing one; the self-seed at
 * boot ({@code SelfSeedService}) is rootless for the same reason — nothing caused it but the
 * process starting.
