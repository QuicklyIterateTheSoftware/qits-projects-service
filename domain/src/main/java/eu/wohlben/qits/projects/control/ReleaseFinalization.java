/**
 * <b>The publish phase: a released tag reaches {@code main} once what it released is live.</b> The
 * far end of the flow {@code ReleaseRequests} opens — a release is a tag, {@code main} is finalized
 * afterwards — and the only thing on this platform that advances {@code main} at all.
 *
 * <h2>The gate</h2>
 *
 * <p>The terminal gate is <b>a deployment reporting active</b>: qits-deployments announces {@code
 * DeploymentActive} for an application and a version, and that version is a released tag of some
 * repository, waiting in {@code released_tag_pending_merge} with a null {@code merged_at}. Nothing
 * else may move {@code main}: merging before the deployment would put a commit there that nothing
 * had proved, which is the shape this epic removed.
 *
 * <p>Passing the gate stamps {@link ReleasedTagPendingMerge#mergeRequestedAt}, and that stamp — not
 * the event, not this thread — is what the merge is owed on. A merge that could not be applied stays
 * owed and the sweep keeps asking, so a git host that was unreachable for an hour costs a delay
 * rather than a release that never lands on {@code main}.
 *
 * <h2>The repositories that have no deployment to wait for</h2>
 *
 * <p>A library deploys nothing, and neither does a stand-alone SPA or a docs repository, so the gate
 * above would never come and their {@code main} would never move again. {@link #onReleased} is the
 * shortcut: <b>at the release</b>, the released tag's tree is read and a repository declaring no
 * {@code .config/qits/deployments.yml} is finalized there and then. <b>That fork lives in exactly
 * one place</b> — {@link #deployability}, reached only from {@link #fork} — and it is
 * <b>temporary</b>, in the sense that its replacement is already named: when qits-maintenance
 * becomes the lifecycle for libraries the way qits-deployments is for services, a consumer taking
 * the new version <em>is</em> the deployment, and this arm goes.
 *
 * <p><b>It hangs off this service's own release and not off qits-ci's {@code SoftwareRelease}</b>,
 * which is where it used to hang and why the arm quietly did nothing for half the platform: that
 * event is emitted by a repository's {@code ci-event-release.yml} recipe, so a repository without
 * one published no artifact event, was never forked on, and left its released tag stranded off
 * {@code main} for ever. A release, by contrast, is something this service performs itself and
 * therefore always knows about.
 *
 * <p>The two gates cannot both fire for one tag: a repository that declares a deployment is left
 * entirely to {@code DeploymentActive}, and the stamped {@code merge_requested_at} settles the race
 * even if it could.
 *
 * <h2>Correlating a deployment back to a release</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>The version is the key, and it is the only key there is.</b> {@code DeploymentActive} names
 * an <em>application</em> and never a repository, and the two are not the same string — the platform
 * builds the application {@code qits-ci} out of the repository {@code qits-ci-service} — so a lookup
 * by repository identity has nothing to look up. A lookup by tag name alone is sound instead,
 * because the calver is unique platform-wide by construction: it is stamped to the second and a
 * collision comes back from the git host as {@code tag-exists}, which restarts the release with a
 * fresh stamp rather than reusing the name. Where two repositories nonetheless hold the same pending
 * tag, the application name is the tie-break and an unbreakable tie merges <b>nothing</b>: a wrong
 * repository's {@code main} is not a thing a later event can take back.
 *
 * <h2>Idempotence</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three layers, and each is load-bearing on its own: a stamped {@code merged_at} short-circuits
 * before any call is made; a repeated gate stamps {@code merge_requested_at} once; and the merge
 * itself is content-idempotent — a tag already contained in {@code main} answers {@code unchanged},
 * which moves no ref and creates no commit. So a replayed {@code DeploymentActive}, a re-deployment
 * of the same version and a sweep racing an event are all free.
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every failed attempt writes its words onto the row and leaves it owed. A {@code 409
 * merge-conflict} is the loud one and is logged {@code ERROR} on every attempt: {@code main} only
 * ever advances through this class, and every release request folds the repository's pending tags
 * in, so a released tag that will not merge into {@code main} is an anomaly and not traffic. It is
 * still retried, because the thing that resolves it — a push to {@code main}, a sibling release
 * landing — is a change this class cannot see and must not have to be told about.
