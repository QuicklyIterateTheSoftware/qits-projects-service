   *
   * <p><b>The repository answers to exactly the new name afterwards, and every old alias goes.</b>
   * That is the decision worth stating, because keeping the old one is the tempting alternative: an
   * alias left behind would keep {@code /git/<project>/<oldName>} resolving, which is precisely what
   * a rename must stop; it would keep the old name taken against every other repository in the
   * project; and it would leave {@code nameFor} — which is what the DTO's {@code name} is — free to
   * answer either one, so the row would have no name a client could rely on.
   *
   * <p><b>The archetype is re-derived from the new name</b>, because under the component layout the
   * name is what says the kind ({@link RepositoryArchetype#fromRepositoryName}). A rename to a
   * suffixed name restamps the row; a rename to a name that declares no role leaves the stored
   * archetype exactly as it was, since "the new name says nothing" is not the same statement as
   * "this repository is nothing", and nothing here could correct a nulled archetype afterwards.
   *
   * <p><b>What is refused:</b> the project's wrapper (its name is derived from the project's slug,
   * which is immutable — {@code <slug>-<slug>} — so renaming it would leave the wrapper addressable
   * under a name the project does not derive), a name that is not a legal addressable segment, and a
   * name another repository in the project already answers to. All three are {@code
   * BadRequestException}.
   *
   * <p><b>Renaming does not touch the wrapper's {@code .gitmodules}.</b> That is step 3 of the
   * per-repo runbook and a push to another service, deliberately not folded in here — but it is why
   * a renamed repository reads as {@code UNDECLARED} until the wrapper entry follows it, and the
   * caller is told so rather than left to discover it. Its <b>backup twin</b> ({@code Repository.url})
   * is not rewritten either, and that one genuinely self-heals: the twin is derived, never stored as
   * a decision — the reconcile folds {@code ../<name>.git} from the wrapper entry against the
   * wrapper's own forge url, so the first reconcile after the entry is renamed repoints it and
   * reports {@code SYNC_TARGET_UPDATED}.
   *
   * <p>The write is rows and nothing else, which is why it is {@code DbRetry.inNewTx} rather than
   * {@code @Transactional} — the module's existing idiom for exactly that ({@code
   * ProjectService.update}) — with the flush last so a severed connection is a certain no-commit and
   * therefore retryable. The <b>announcement is made after that transaction, never inside it</b>:
   * the body re-runs on a retry, and an announcement in it would be made twice.
