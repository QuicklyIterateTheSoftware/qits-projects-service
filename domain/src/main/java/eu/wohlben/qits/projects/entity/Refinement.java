/**
 * One epic's refinement container, as this service hosts it — the row behind the projects SPA's
 * refining route, which used to be an ordinary qits-workspaces workspace on a {@code refining/*}
 * branch.
 *
 * <p><b>Keyed by epic, addressed by row id.</b> An epic has at most one refinement (the unique
 * constraint on {@code epic_id} is what makes find-or-create race-safe), and every URL — lifecycle
 * verbs, the daemon proxy, the SSE channel — carries the numeric row id, the same shape the
 * workspaces domain used and the shape the SPA's panels already take.
 *
 * <p><b>The epic id is a key, not a relation.</b> The epic lives in the {@code epics} module's own
 * database and Flyway lineage; a foreign key across persistence units is not a thing, and the epics
 * module deliberately depends on nothing here. The row is torn down by an explicit discard, never
 * by a cascade from a table it cannot see.
 *
 * <p><b>The commissioned credential is two columns, and that is forced rather than chosen.</b> The
 * pair reaches the container as environment, and qits-containers hashes a workload's whole spec —
 * environment included — to decide whether an {@code ensure} may start the container in place or
 * must replace it. A wake that could not reproduce the same two values byte for byte would be a
 * spec change destroying the container on every resume. The same argument, at length, on {@link
 * AgentCredential}.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}.</b> The insert runs on the request thread that opened the refining
 * route, so the stamp records what asked for it.
