/**
 * Reconciles a packaged qits deployment into a seeded "qits" project holding the qits repositories
 * themselves — the startup counterpart to the cli {@code seed}/{@code seed-webapp} demos (see
 * {@code docs/epics/qits-live-deployment/features/2026-07-19_startup-qits-self-seed.md}). Where
 * those seeds define a demo world programmatically, this one only registers the real repositories.
 * Their committed {@code .qits-config.yml} (services, actions, bootstrap chain) is the
 * workspace-scoped source of truth, read <b>in-container per workspace</b> by the workspace-daemon
 * — nothing is ingested into DB rows on clone (the repo-scoped config store was removed in Part 5,
 * {@code
 * docs/epics/qits-workspace-daemon/features/2026-07-24_config-as-single-source-of-truth.md}).
 *
 * <p>The seed is a one-line in-code {@linkplain #manifest() manifest} — the project and its
 * wrapper repository — <b>reconciled on every boot</b>. It used to carry
 * a second, hand-maintained list of every platform repository the git host serves, one entry per
 * superproject submodule with its archetype spelled out beside it. <b>That list is gone.</b> The
 * superproject's own {@code .gitmodules} is that manifest, it is committed where the repositories
 * themselves live, and {@link WrapperReconcileService} reads it — so a repository joins qits by
 * being added to the wrapper, not by being added to a Java file that has to be deployed to take
 * effect. The old list's one virtue, "an entry with no origin here yet is skipped silently on every
 * boot", is preserved exactly: that is the reconcile's own adopt/clone/skip decision.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotency is per item, not per seed</b>:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The project (named {@value #PROJECT_NAME}) is created if absent, matched by name otherwise.
 *   <li>The wrapper's row is asserted onto the manifest, then it goes through the adopt seam and is
 *       reconciled — which registers or adopts every component it declares and reports every
 *       component row it does not.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Per-item matching also makes partial failure self-healing: a boot that created the project but
 * lost a clone to a network blip completes the missing pieces on the next boot, with no wedged
 * "already seeded" state. Each item is reconciled in its own try/catch, so one failing repository
 * never aborts the rest — the boot leaves a usable instance and the next reconcile retries exactly
 * the failed items.
 *
 * <p>The launch-mode gate (packaged runs only) and the off-startup-thread dispatch live in the
 * {@code service} module's startup bean; this service is the pure, testable reconcile logic. {@link
 * ActivateRequestContext} so the non-transactional reads ({@code list()}, {@code getRepositories})
 * work when this runs on a worker thread with no ambient request context
 * (the cli seeds model the same pattern); the individual service calls still own their own
 * transactions.
