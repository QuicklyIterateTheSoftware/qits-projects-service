/**
 * One ask to release, settled by quality gates before anything ships — the asynchronous replacement
 * for calling the release door and hoping the build was green.
 *
 * <p><b>A request is an OCTOPUS MERGE of N sources, not a branch head.</b> Its participants are the
 * named branches on {@link ReleaseRequestSource} ({@code main} is implied by every create) plus the
 * repository's released tags not yet merged to {@code main} ({@link ReleasedTagPendingMerge}) —
 * folded into a backing branch of the request's own, {@code release/<id>}, by qits-githost's merge
 * primitive. {@link #mergedSha} is the tip of that fold: the one sha that is the whole of what would
 * be released, and therefore the one thing the gates evaluate and the execution is pinned to.
 *
 * <p><b>The re-merge is the re-arm.</b> Anything that changes what the fold would produce — a push
 * to a participating branch, a source added, a sibling release adding an implicit tag, a pending tag
 * reaching {@code main} — re-folds the sources and lands a new {@link #mergedSha}, which invalidates
 * the gates and puts the request back to PENDING. That is the same merge-request shape the single-
 * branch model had, generalised: pushing a fix onto a rejected request is still the ordinary way to
 * answer it. A fold that produces nothing new ({@code unchanged} at the git host) is not a change
 * and re-arms nothing.
 *
 * <p>The state machine: {@code PENDING → READY → RELEASED}; {@code PENDING → REJECTED} when a
 * gating verdict is red; {@code READY → FAILED → READY} around a mechanical execution failure —
 * retried by the sweep only while {@link #retryable} says asking again can change the answer;
 * {@code → CONFLICTED} when the sources cannot be folded at all, cleared by the next fold that
 * succeeds; a new merged sha re-arms {@code REJECTED}, {@code FAILED} and {@code CONFLICTED} back to
 * {@code PENDING}; {@code WITHDRAWN} is reserved for an explicit withdrawal. Stored as a string with
 * no check constraint, the platform's usual reasoning — which is why CONFLICTED cost no DDL.
 *
 * <p>A {@link CausedRow}: created on the request thread, so the stamp records what asked. Updates
 * (the re-merge, gate resolution, execution) are machine-driven and the stamp is insert-only — the
 * verdicts that resolved a request are their own caused rows in {@code commit_build_status}.
