/**
 * Brings a project's rows in line with its wrapper's {@code .gitmodules}.
 *
 * <p>The wrapper <b>is</b> the project's configuration, and this is what makes that true of the
 * database too: every entry gets a row, and every row that is a component of the project and has no
 * entry is reported as undeclared. Importing a wrapper url and running this is how a whole project
 * is restored.
 *
 * <p><b>One path grammar, {@code components/<component>/<name>}</b> ({@link WrapperPath}), and it
 * states which component an entry belongs to rather than what kind of thing it is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the second segment becomes the row's {@code component}, on every pass;
 *   <li><b>an existing row keeps the archetype it has.</b> Nothing in the path says a kind, so there
 *       is nothing to re-derive one from, and re-typing a live platform's rows off a path is exactly
 *       what this must never do;
 *   <li>a row this reconcile <em>mints</em> takes its archetype from the name's role suffix ({@link
 *       eu.wohlben.qits.projects.entity.RepositoryArchetype#fromRepositoryName}), and null when the
 *       name declares none — which is the honest answer and the least destructive one, since a null
 *       archetype is never reported undeclared and so is never offered for the delete that would
 *       destroy the repository, while a guessed one would be a wrong label nothing here can correct.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>It replaces the recursive submodule import, which had the relationship backwards: it walked
 * whatever a repository happened to reference, at any depth, and registered all of it as siblings
 * with a guessed archetype. What belongs to a project is a decision somebody makes and commits, not
 * a graph a crawler found.
 *
 * <p>Per entry, and each one is a decision this class is allowed to make on its own:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>a path that is not {@code components/<component>/<name>} is <b>skipped</b> with a warning —
 *       guessing what {@code vendor/x} or {@code components/a/b/c} means would be inventing
 *       taxonomy;
 *   <li>a matching row keeps its repository, its kind and its history, and takes the entry's
 *       component;
 *   <li>no row, but the git host already serves a repository under that name — <b>adopted</b>, id
 *       and history intact;
 *   <li>no row and nothing served, but the entry's url resolves to a reachable backend — <b>cloned
 *       </b>, one level, because the wrapper is the whole manifest and its children's own submodules
 *       are their own business;
 *   <li>anything else is skipped with a warning that says what was missing.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>This reconcile deletes nothing (2026-08-26).</b> A row that is a component of the project
 * and that no entry names is reported {@code UNDECLARED} and left exactly as it is. Deleting a repository destroys its history
 * on the git host now, and an edit to one file is not consent to that — so the answer names the
 * rows, and a person decides in the UI whether to delete one or put its wrapper entry back.
 *
 * <p>Every item is reconciled in its own try/catch. One entry that cannot be resolved never denies
 * the rest, and the outcome list is the answer rather than an exception — the same shape as {@code
 * ProjectReconcileService}'s dns re-assert.
