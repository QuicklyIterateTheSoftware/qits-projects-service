/**
 * Tells the rest of the platform that a release request's <b>content</b> changed — a new fold landed
 * on its backing branch, so there is a new sha to build, gate and eventually release.
 *
 * <p>A port, for the reason every other reach out of {@code domain} is one: the announcement leaves
 * over {@code qits-eventstream}'s bus, and {@code domain} does not know the event bus exists. The
 * one implementation is {@code service/…/bus/ReleaseRequestChangedAnnouncer}.
 *
 * <p><b>What it is for.</b> qits-ci is the motivating consumer: a release request's backing branch
 * is not a branch anybody pushed, so no {@code SCMPublishCommit} ever announces it — the git host's
 * merge primitive deliberately fires no post-receive. Without this event the fold would exist and
 * nothing would build it.
 *
 * <p><b>Only a real change is announced.</b> A fold that produced nothing new ({@code unchanged} at
 * the git host — every head already contained, same sha, no new commit) is not a change: announcing
 * it would ask for a build of a sha already built, and the triggers that fire on a set that did not
 * really move (a duplicate delivery, a pending tag leaving) are exactly the ones that produce it.
 *
 * <p><b>Absent is a supported configuration</b>, like every port here: with no implementation a
 * request still merges and simply announces nothing, which is what {@code domain}'s own suite runs
 * as. Injected as an {@code Instance<T>} for that reason. <b>Nothing here may throw</b>, and nothing
 * here may be called inside a transaction the caller needs.

   *     must publish without it rather than refuse: nothing acts on it yet, and a fold must never
   *     fail over a field. It is a fold-time reading, so an escalation made after this event is

   *     time, is what carries the late one.
   * @param downstreamTechnicalComponents what is built on top of this repository, ordered
   *     nearest-first, as {@link DownstreamComponents} answered at the moment of the fold. Nullable,
   *     and an implementation must publish without it rather than refuse: null means the question
   *     could not be asked and an empty list means it was asked and this repository is a leaf — two
   *     different facts, and a consumer must be able to tell them apart. It is advisory throughout;
   *     its one reader orders a build queue with it and never refuses a build over it.
