/**
 * Commits a component into — or out of — its project's wrapper repository.
 *
 * <p>A project <em>is</em> its wrapper, and this is the only writer of that fact: a repository that
 * is not a {@code .gitmodules} entry is not part of the project. Both verbs are one commit on the
 * wrapper's main branch, made with no working tree at all, and published by a push like every other
 * ref this service moves.
 *
 * <p>The commit carries two things and they must agree:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the amended {@code .gitmodules} blob ({@link WrapperGitmodules}), and
 *   <li>a {@code 160000} gitlink at the entry's path — {@code components/<component>/<name>}, the
 *       project's one grammar, see {@link WrapperPath} — pinned to the child's main-branch head
 *       <em>as it is at add time</em>. Nothing here follows the child afterwards; a gitlink
 *       bump is an ordinary commit somebody makes later.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>The child must already be on the git host.</b> A gitlink records a sha without resolving it,
 * so a wrapper commit naming a commit the host has never seen would push fine and then break every
 * clone that tried to materialize it. Both callers publish the child first.
 *
 * <p>The push carries the host token, because the wrapper's default branch is protected like every
 * other, and it carries no {@code qits.no-ci}: a wrapper commit is a real change to the project and
 * fires CI exactly like a person's push would. Two concurrent creates race for the same branch tip,
 * so a lost fast-forward is retried from a fresh read — three times, which is a race that has to
 * happen three times in a row to fail.

   * it saw the newer tip in the advertisement, and refuses it server-side when the ref moved
   * between the advertisement and the ref transaction. A hook declining the push is neither and
   * must never be retried.

   * <p><b>The server-side shape is receive-pack's own wording and it is not the wording

   * {@code remote: error:} line and never reaches the summary. Matching only {@code incorrect old

   * every genuinely lost race as a refusal and answered 400 instead of re-reading — measured
   * against git 2.39. So the summary is read for receive-pack's word and the whole output for the
   * lock detail behind it.
   *
   * <p>A permanent {@code failed to update ref} — a directory/file clash on the ref name, say — is
   * retried too and then reported as the exhausted-attempts failure, which carries the output the
   * detail line is in. Three cheap re-reads are the right price for never mistaking a race for a
