/**
 * One <b>named</b> participant of a release request — a branch somebody put on it.
 *
 * <p>A release request is an octopus merge of N sources now, and they come from two places. This
 * table holds the ones a <b>caller chose</b>: {@code main} (implied by every create) plus each
 * branch named at creation or added later. The other kind — the repository's released tags not yet
 * merged to {@code main} — is <b>derived</b> from {@link ReleasedTagPendingMerge} and deliberately
 * has no row here: it is a fact about the repository at this moment, not a choice about this
 * request, and a tag that reached {@code main} must leave every request's source set at once. A row
 * here would have to be deleted from N requests to do that, and would be wrong in between.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #name} is the branch's own name, never a ref.</b> {@code refs/heads/} is the git
 * host's spelling and is applied where the merge is called, so a row stays readable by a person and
 * one place decides the prefix.
 *
 * <p>A {@link CausedRow}: every insert happens on the request thread that asked for it — the create
 * and the add-source route — so the stamp records what asked. The re-merge never writes one.
