/**
 * The arm that performs a release once its gates have passed.
 *
 * <p><b>It used to be a door and it is a procedure now.</b> Until 2026-09-03 this port called
 * qits-workspaces' {@code /branches/execute-release}, which merged the branch into {@code main},
 * bumped, committed, pushed, tagged and promoted — and the release flow this epic builds does none
 * of that: a release is a <b>tag</b>, {@code main} is finalized after the deployment, and the
 * content being released is a fold that exists only on the git host. So the whole of what an
 * implementation does now is: stamp a version, rewrite the manifests at the fold, commit them onto
 * the backing branch, tag that commit, delete the branches the release consumed, and announce it.
 * {@code qits.projects.release-requests.workspaces-url} went with the door.
 *
 * <p><b>The ask says nothing about archetypes any more.</b> Until the pins moved into the fold, the
 * WRAPPER's release carried a catalog of its project's other repositories with it, so that the
 * executor could read each one's head and bank a gitlink for it in the release commit — which made
 * {@code RepositoryArchetype.PROJECT} a question the <em>release path</em> had to ask, and made the
 * estate that shipped something computed after the gate and after the person approving had read the
 * fold. The pins are written onto the source branch now, before either, so the catalog went with the
 * banking arm and this record is the same seven-and-a-bit facts for every repository the platform
 * holds. What is released is a fold, and nothing here asks what kind of repository it came from.
 *
 * <p>A port in the house shape: {@code Instance}-resolved, absent supported — a deployment with no
 * executor leaves every READY request standing with a detail that says why, which is a visible
 * refusal rather than a silent one. An implementation <b>must not throw</b>: every outcome is an
 * {@link Outcome}, and {@code released=false} carries the reason.

  /**
   * Everything one release is about. A record rather than a parameter list because the tag-only
   * flow needs the request's own identity and its source set, and an eight-argument signature that
   * grew two more would be the kind nobody can read a call site of.
   *
   * @param requestId the release request — its own id, and the tail of {@link #backingBranch}
   * @param repoId the repository's storage id, the git host's key
   * @param projectId the project the repository belongs to, or null
   * @param repoName the repository's registered name, or null. Rides onto {@code SCMRelease}, where
   *     it is the coordinate a committed CI selection can address.
   * @param backingBranch {@code release/<id>} — <b>what is released</b>: the fold, not any one
   *     participant
   * @param mergedSha the fold the gates evaluated. The manifests are read at this commit and the
   *     bump lands on top of it.
   * @param summary what the requester said this release is, for the commit and the tag message
   * @param requester who asked, or null
   * @param namedSources the request's named source branches, {@code main} included — deleted on
   *     success, <b>except</b> {@link #defaultBranch}, which is never deleted by anything
   * @param defaultBranch the repository's default branch, so the exclusion above is a fact rather
   *     than a guess at the string {@code "main"}
   * @param priority the request's effective priority — the max over {@link #namedSources}' rows, as
   *     the constant's own name. Computed <b>at release time</b> rather than carried from the fold,
   *     so an escalation made while the request waited on its gate reaches the tag's announcement.
   *     Nullable and inert: an executor rides it onto {@code SCMRelease} and decides nothing with
   *     it.
