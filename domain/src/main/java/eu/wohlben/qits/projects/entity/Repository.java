/**
 * A git remote as an entity: one bare origin on disk, its backup twin, and the row that names both.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}, and the one in this context worth tracing.</b> Rows are minted by four
 * paths and all four run on a request thread — {@code cloneOne}, {@code createBlankRepository},
 * {@code initWrapperOrigin} and {@code adoptExistingOrigin} — so the {@code CausationStamp}
 * listener reads the scope the {@code X-Qits-Causation-Id} filter restored. The machine-driven one
 * is {@code WrapperReconcileService}: a reconcile called with a cause records, per adopted or cloned
 * member, what asked for it. A browser-driven create carries no header and is rootless, and so is
 * every row the boot-time self-seed writes — neither is a hole, both are "nothing caused this".
 *
 * <p>Nothing sets the value explicitly, because there is no hop to cross: the backup executor and
 * the pull executor UPDATE these rows and never insert one, and the stamp is insert-only.
