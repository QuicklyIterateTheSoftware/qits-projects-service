/**
 * Keeps every repository's forge twin in step with the git host, without anybody having to remember
 * to push. "In step" means the main branch and every tag, not every branch — see {@link
 * RepositoryService#backupToTwin} for why a platform branch is deliberately left out.
 *
 * <p>Two triggers, and they are different jobs. The git host's {@code post-receive} calls {@link
 * #onPush} the moment a push is accepted, which is what makes the twin current within seconds of
 * real work. The scheduled sweep calls {@link #backupAll} on an interval, which is what makes it
 * <em>eventually</em> current after a missed event, an unreachable forge or an expired credential —
 * the thing an event-driven design alone quietly does not give you.
 *
 * <p><b>Debounced and serialized per repository</b>, because one {@code git push} is many events: a
 * push of three branches fires three post-receives, and a naive listener would run three backups of
 * the same repository, concurrently, against the same mirror. A repository already scheduled absorbs
 * further events into the run it is waiting for, and a per-repository lock means the sweep and an
 * event-driven run can never overlap.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing here throws.</b> It is called from a fire-and-forget HTTP intake and from a
 * scheduler; there is no caller left to hand a failure to, and a backup that could fail a push would
 * be worse than no backup at all. Failures are logged — an auth wall by name, through the same
 * classifier the sign-in terminal keys off — and the drift they leave is exactly what {@code
 * syncStatus} already reports on the repository's own screen.
