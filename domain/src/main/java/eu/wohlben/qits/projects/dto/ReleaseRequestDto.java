/**
 * One release request as the API answers it. {@code state} is the stored word — {@code PENDING},
 * {@code READY}, {@code RELEASED}, {@code REJECTED}, {@code FAILED}, {@code CONFLICTED} or {@code
 * WITHDRAWN} today, and the vocabulary may grow. {@code detail} is the sentence explaining a request
 * that is not simply pending or released; {@code version} is the calver the release answered with,
 * once it did. {@code retryable} says, of a FAILED request, whether the sweep keeps retrying the
 * execution or the refusal stands until something re-arms it.
 *
 * <p><b>A request is a merge of {@code sources}, not a branch head.</b> {@code backingBranch} is
 * {@code release/<id>} — the ref the git host folds them into — and {@code mergedSha} is the tip of
 * that fold: what the gates evaluate and what an execution is pinned to. {@code mergedSha} is
 * <b>null until the first fold lands</b>, and null on a CONFLICTED request whose first fold never
 * did; a caller reads that as "nothing is gated yet", never as "nothing to release".
 *
 * <p>{@code sources} carries both kinds — the named branches somebody put on the request and the
 * implicit released tags the repository has in flight — with {@code implicit} telling them apart.
 * Only the named ones are caller-managed.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code priority} is the request's EFFECTIVE priority: the max over its named branch
 * sources.</b> Urgency is stated per participating branch — each was put on the request by somebody
 * with their own reason — so the request's own answer is the highest of them, which is the only
 * reading that cannot lose an escalation. Derived on every read rather than stored, never null
 * ({@code MEDIUM} where nothing says otherwise), and a word rather than a closed set, because the
 * vocabulary may grow. The implicit tag sources are not in the max: they carry no priority at all.
 *
 * <p>{@code conflict} is populated on a CONFLICTED request and null on every other, so a caller
 * never has to ask a second question to find out what to resolve.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code releasedSha} is what the tag points at</b> — the commit the version bump produced,
 * which is the fold plus the rewritten manifests and is therefore <em>not</em> {@code mergedSha}. It
 * is what a reader needs to open the release in the code browser, and it is the sha the merge to
 * {@code main} is made from. Null on every request that has not released, and null on a release made
 * before the column existed (V13): a platform cannot invent what it did not record.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code mergedToMainAt} is the end of the lifecycle</b>, and it is the only place a reader
 * can see it: a release is a tag and {@code main} is finalized after the deployment succeeds, so a
 * RELEASED request whose {@code version} is set and whose {@code mergedToMainAt} is null is a
 * release that shipped and has not reached {@code main} yet — waiting for its deployment, or stuck
 * on a merge that will not apply. Null on every request that has not released, where there is
 * nothing to have reached {@code main}.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code unattended} says nobody is waiting on this request.</b> It is derived, never stored:
 * true where the {@code requester} is one of the platform's machine identities — a maintenance bump
 * asked for this release and stopped — and it is the difference between a REJECTED request somebody
 * is answering and one that is simply stuck with no reader. A listing that shows both as "rejected"
 * is how a repository stops moving for four hours without anybody noticing. It is true whatever the
 * state, because who asked does not change when the gate does; a caller that wants "unowned AND
 * blocked" reads it together with {@code state}. {@code gateTicketId} is the ticket filed for such a
 * rejection — null until one is, and null for ever on a request a person opened.
 *
 * <p>{@code repoName} is the repository's public name — null where it has none. It rides along
 * because a request read outside its repository's own page (the project-wide list) has nothing else
 * to name the repository with, and an opaque id is not a thing to show a person. The project list
 * resolves it live from the alias table so a rename is reflected; every other read answers the name
 * recorded when the request was made.
