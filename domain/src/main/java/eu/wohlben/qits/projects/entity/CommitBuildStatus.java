/**
 * One CI run's terminal verdict about a commit — the per-commit build-status ledger, fed from
 * qits-ci's {@code BuildSuccessful}/{@code BuildFailed} events by {@code
 * service/…/bus/BuildStatusListener}.
 *
 * <p>Keyed on the <b>run</b>, not the commit: a commit can carry several runs (a push pipeline and
 * event pipelines), and what a reader wants is the set of verdicts, which it folds by its own
 * policy. Cancelled and superseded runs never publish, so every row here is a
 * build that genuinely ran — or genuinely could not run — against exactly that commit; what is
 * <em>not</em> knowable from this table is a run that is still queued or running, because only
 * terminal runs announce. The release quality gate this ledger exists for reads it accordingly.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code runId} is a key, never a relation.</b> The run row lives in qits-ci's own database;
 * no foreign key can span a context boundary and none is coming. Same for {@code repoId}: rows
 * outlive repositories deliberately, because a verdict about a commit does not stop having happened
 * when the repository is archived.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow} whose cause is set explicitly</b>, from the consumed frame's id, the
 * qits-ci lesson applied: the write happens under the durable funnel's dispatch, and passing the id
 * as data is what survives every thread and restart the ambient scope does not.
