/**
 * The release-request state machine: N sources folded onto a backing branch, settled by quality
 * gates, executed when they pass. The reason the build-status ledger lives in this service — a
 * verdict arrives, the ledger row is written, and the matching requests resolve in the same
 * consumption.
 *
 * <h2>A request is an octopus merge</h2>
 *
 * <p>Its participants are the <b>named branches</b> on it ({@code main} is implied by every create,
 * and more are added later) plus the <b>implicit tag sources</b>: every released tag of the
 * repository not yet merged to {@code main}. The implicit set is what makes each release a superset
 * of the releases still in flight — a release is a tag and {@code main} is finalized only after the
 * deployment, so between those two moments a request that did not fold the tag in would be a step
 * backwards from what is already shipping.
 *
 * <p>{@link #remerge} folds them into {@code refs/heads/release/<id>} through {@link
 * BackingBranchMerger} and stores the tip as {@code mergedSha}. <b>That fold is the re-arm</b>:
 * a new tip invalidates the gates and puts the request back to PENDING, exactly as a new branch head
 * used to. Four things trigger it, and each is per-request — a shared trigger is never a shared
 * merge, and one request's fold never touches a sibling's backing branch:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>the request being created, and a source being added to it;
 *   <li>a push touching any of its named branches ({@link #onBranchMoved}, off {@code
 *       SCMPublishCommit});
 *   <li>a sibling release JOINING the implicit set — every open request of that repository re-folds,
 *       and it is a real change;
 *   <li>a pending tag LEAVING the set on reaching {@code main} ({@link #onReleasedTagMerged}) —
 *       content-idempotent, so the fold usually answers {@code unchanged} and nothing is announced.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>{@code unchanged} is not a change.</b> The git host answers it when every head is already
 * contained in the target: same sha, no new commit. Nothing is re-armed and no {@code
 * ReleaseRequestChanged} is dispatched, which is what makes a trigger with no content behind it
 * free. A fold that cannot be made at all is {@code CONFLICTED} — no ref moved, the conflict stored
 * for a person to act on, and <b>no event</b>; the next fold that succeeds clears it and dispatches,
 * <em>including</em> one answering {@code unchanged}, unless that sha already carries a gating
 * verdict the gate can read.
 *
 * <h2>The build gate</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Exactly one thing meets it: a gating {@code BuildSuccessful} whose commit is this request's
 * CURRENT fold.</b> A PENDING request becomes READY when, for its {@code mergedSha}:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>No gating verdict is red.</b> One red gating run is a REJECTED request, immediately —
 *       nothing to wait for. Non-gating verdicts (the userflow pipelines) are read and ignored.
 *   <li><b>A gating verdict is green.</b> That is the vouch and there is no second way to earn it.
 *       <b>No verdict is not a pass</b>: the request stays PENDING and the sweep asks again, for as
 *       long as it takes. A repository whose pipeline never materializes therefore cannot release,
 *       and that is what a release gate is <em>for</em>.
 *   <li><b>No run is still queued or running</b>, where qits-ci can be asked. The ledger cannot see
 *       those (only terminal runs announce), so {@link ActiveBuilds} asks; a second gating pipeline
 *       still grinding on the same fold could still come back red, and a positive count holds the
 *       request. An answer that cannot be had does <b>not</b> hold a vouched sha back — the green
 *       gating verdict is the gate, the probe only ever narrows it.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>There was a fourth arm and it was a hole.</b> A sha nothing vouched for used to pass
 * vacuously once a settle window had lapsed, on the theory that a repository with no CI must still
 * be releasable. What it actually did — QA runs are created over the bus and executed by one serial
 * runner, so the active-runs probe answers 0 while a run is still being accepted — was wave releases
 * through in under two minutes, before their QA runs had executed at all (measured 2026-09-04). The
 * window is gone, with the property that configured it.
 *
 * <p>A request with no {@code mergedSha} yet is gated on nothing and stays PENDING: the fold has not
 * been computed, so there is no content to have an opinion about.
 *
 * <p><b>The merged sha is the correlation key, in both directions.</b> Only a verdict naming the
 * request's <em>current</em> fold can flip it — one for a superseded merge matches no request and is
 * simply not read — and the ledger rows of superseded merges are kept rather than deleted, because
 * they are the record of what was built. That is what makes the gate safe without anybody stopping
 * the runs, which in turn is what lets the run cancellation a re-fold asks for be best effort: it
 * frees a build agent, it does not decide anything. See {@link #evaluate(String, String)} and {@link
 * QaRunCancellations}.
 *
 * <h2>The release</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>Execution happens off every other thread.</b> A READY request is handed to the one-thread
 * {@code release-request-worker}: the resolution runs under the bus consumption and the sweep on a
 * scheduler thread, and the release is several HTTP round trips neither may sit on. The worker
 * re-reads the row, so a request executed twice over is settled by the first arrival.
 *
 * <p>What {@link ReleaseExecutor} does is stamp a calver, rewrite the manifests at the fold, commit
 * them onto the backing branch, <b>tag</b> that commit, delete the branches the release consumed and
 * announce {@code SCMRelease}. There is no push to {@code main} in it: a release is a tag, and
 * {@code main} is finalized after the deployment. This class's own share of that is the bookkeeping
 * — {@link #recordReleasedTag} puts the new tag in the repository's implicit source set and re-folds
 * every <em>other</em> open request, so each of them is a superset of what is already shipping.
