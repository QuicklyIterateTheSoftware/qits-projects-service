/**
 * A clean platform state before <b>every test method</b>: empty projects tables, an empty mirror
 * root and an empty fake git host.
 *
 * <p>Row ids are minted UUIDs again, so two tests cloning the same fixture no longer collide on the
 * id — but everything else a test leaves behind still carries into the next method: a project slug
 * (unique service-wide), a bare on the fake git host under a hand-chosen storage id, a mirror
 * directory. {@link RepoDataDirReset}'s per-class wipe is not enough for any of those, which is why
 * this is per-method. Tests stay as they are; the slate is what resets.
 *
 * <p>A Quarkus callback rather than a JUnit extension because the reset needs the running
 * application: the datasource bean for the truncate, and the live config for the mirror root (a
 * {@code @TestProfile} may point {@code qits.projects.data-dir} at its own directory). Registered
 * via {@code META-INF/services}, and carried to {@code service}'s suite in this module's test-jar
 * like the rest of {@code testsupport}. Under a {@code @QuarkusIntegrationTest} there is no
 * container in this JVM and the launched process owns its own state, so the callback stands down.
