/**
 * Resolves a git fixture to an absolute path on disk, building the derived ones on first use.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists.</b> In the monorepo the {@code testing-repo*} fixtures are committed as
 * <em>git submodules</em> (working trees), and a {@code derive-fixture-bares} antrun step
 * (scripts/derive-fixture-bares.sh, bound to {@code process-test-resources}) turned each one into a
 * bare repo on the test classpath. migration-plan.md §8 step 4 drops that antrun step, and
 * §5 lists the four fixture gitlinks as "already separate repos, re-attach as submodules". Neither
 * option survives the extraction gate: re-attaching submodules makes {@code mvn verify} from a
 * plain {@code git clone} fail (nothing is checked out, and the derive step exits non-zero), and
 * that gate — green from a clone of this repo alone, no monorepo, no docker, no credentials — is
 * the whole point. So the fixtures are <b>built in-test</b>, like qits-ci's and qits-artifacts'.
 *
 * <p>Only the DERIVED bares are synthesized. The {@code submodule-*.git} fixtures are committed
 * bare repos in {@code src/test/resources/fixtures} and are used exactly as they are; this class
 * returns their classpath path unchanged. The derived ones are written <em>into the same
 * directory</em>, which is where the antrun step put them, so a superproject's relative submodule
 * url still folds to a sibling bare.
 *
 * <p>{@code testing-repo.git} reproduces the fixture repository commit for commit — two branches
 * off a shared root, {@code master} three commits deep so a rewind-and-fast-forward has somewhere
 * to go, {@code feature} diverging with its own file, and both touching {@code hello.txt} so a
 * forced conflict is reachable. The commit shas differ from the original (author, dates); nothing
 * asserts on them.
