/**
 * One real PostgreSQL for this module's whole surefire JVM.
 *
 * <p><b>Why not a container.</b> The first rule of this repo is that a clone builds and tests green
 * with no docker, and both stores are postgres now — so Testcontainers and Quarkus dev services are
 * both out, and the schema still has to be exercised against the database it actually ships on.
 * Zonky resolves real postgres binaries as ordinary Maven artifacts and this class spawns them as a
 * child process: a dependency, not a daemon.
 *
 * <p><b>This copy travels to {@code service} in the test-jar</b>, which is what {@code domain}'s jar
 * plugin already ships for the port implementations, so the deployable's suite reuses it rather than
 * starting a second kind of postgres. {@code entities} has its OWN copy instead: that module depends on
 * nothing, deliberately, and a test-jar dependency on {@code domain} is the higher price. What is
 * never shared is the database NAME — every (module, datasource) pair names its own, so two suites
 * cannot mean the same schema.
 *
 * <p><b>The instance is tracked in a system property, not in this static field alone.</b> A Quarkus
 * test run loads config sources in more than one classloader, so a second copy of this class is
 * loaded with its own statics; the property is the one thing they share, and it is what keeps the
 * count at one postgres per JVM instead of one per classloader.
