/**
 * The whole reverse path, end to end, with this test playing the daemon: control socket → {@code
 * OpenStream} → dial-back → byte pipe → the daemon's own API.
 *
 * <p>Nothing smaller proves what matters here. A stub origin reached directly would show neither of
 * the two defects this design exists around — that {@code vertx-http-proxy} drops its interceptors
 * on an upgrade, and that a tunnel with no backpressure is a heap leak — and, more to the point,
 * would not prove that the request the daemon receives is the request the browser sent. So the
 * fixture is a real loopback HTTP server standing in for {@code ProjectsApi}, reached only the way
 * a real one is reachable: over a connection this test dialled out.
 *
 * <p>Three things are asserted, and each is a rule stated somewhere else in this package:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the bearer is <b>set</b> by the proxy, never carried by the caller;
 *   <li>the path is forwarded <b>verbatim</b>, prefix included, because the daemon was told that
 *       prefix is its own address;
 *   <li>a nonce is <b>single-use</b> — the second dial-back with the same one is refused.
