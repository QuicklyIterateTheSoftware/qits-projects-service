/**
 * The platform state a story <b>walks through</b> rather than creates — one project, one component
 * repository, and one bare the git host already serves.
 *
 * <h2>Setup is invisible to both taps, by construction</h2>
 *
 * <p>A story's diagram must show the walk somebody takes, not the fixture somebody built. So nothing
 * here touches either of the two things a story is observed through:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>The inbound tap</b> is the framework's RestAssured filter, which is JVM-global once
 *       installed. This class therefore drives the API with a plain {@link HttpClient} — a client
 *       no filter is attached to — so not one fixture request becomes an arrow into qits-projects.
 *   <li><b>The outbound tap</b> is the git host's own access log, and the fixture's project
 *       creation genuinely does reach it. That one is bounded by <b>order</b> instead:
 *       {@link #provision()} runs before {@link StoryGitHost#install()} in every story class's
 *       {@code @BeforeAll}, and install takes the end of the recording as its floor.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The seeded bare goes further and touches no wire at all: it is written straight onto the
 * fixture's disk with a plain {@code git init --bare}, which is a plane neither tap can see — and
 * which is also the truth about a platform whose repositories are created on the git host by
 * qits-cli-bootstrap long before any row here names them.
 *
 * <h2>Provisioned once, for whichever story class runs first</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every story class calls {@link #provision()}; the first one does the work and the rest find it
 * done. That is what makes each class runnable on its own ({@code -Dit.test=EpicPlanningIT}) while
 * a full run still provisions exactly once — and it is why the floor is correct in both cases,
 * since the only provisioning there ever is happens before the only install there ever is.
 *
 * <h2>The ids are minted, the names are readable</h2>
 *
 * <p>A project's slug is unique and immutable, so the fixture's carries a run stamp; nothing about
 * that reaches a diagram, because a project id and a repository id are UUIDs and {@link
 * eu.wohlben.qits.userflows.Labels} rewrites a whole UUID path segment to {@code {id}}. The seeded
 * bare's storage id is the one exception and is deliberately a <b>readable literal</b>: it is a
 * storage key the bootstrap chose, it survives scrubbing unchanged, and {@code GET
 * /git/bootstrap-seeded-repo -> 200} says which repository was adopted where {@code GET /git/{id}}
 * would say nothing at all.
