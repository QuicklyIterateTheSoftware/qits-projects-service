/**
 * The alias table with a postgres cutover in it: the next reads throw the exception a caller
 * actually sees when its connection dies mid-flight, then the table answers normally again.
 *
 * <p>The failure is the real shape rather than a marker — Hibernate's {@code JDBCConnectionException}
 * wrapping postgres' {@code 57P01} ("terminating connection due to administrator command"), which is
 * what the server says to every open connection while it is being replaced. {@code DbRetry} decides
 * what to retry by walking that cause chain, so a stand-in exception would prove the retry runs and
 * not that it fires on a cutover.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @Alternative} with no {@code @Priority}</b>: it is enabled by one test profile,
 * `RepositoryCatalogueTest.DeployedPosture`, which `RepositoryNameCutoverTest` shares, and is inert
 * in every other class of this suite. A globally enabled one would sit in the path of every
 * repository read here, armed or not.
 *
 * <p><b>The two reads are armed separately</b> — {@link #loseTheConnection} for name resolution,
 * {@link #loseTheConnectionNaming} for the reverse read the catalogue does — because an unrelated
 * background sweep touching one would otherwise spend the other test's armed failure, and a test
 * whose failure was consumed elsewhere passes while proving nothing.
