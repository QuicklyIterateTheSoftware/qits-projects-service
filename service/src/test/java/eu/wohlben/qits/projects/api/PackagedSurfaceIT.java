/**
 * The surface of the <em>packaged artifact</em> — the fast-jar normally, the GraalVM binary under
 * {@code -Dnative} — because that is the only place a whole class of failure is visible.
 *
 * <p>Every other test here is a {@code @QuarkusTest}: it augments and runs in the build JVM, with
 * the full classpath present and reflection unrestricted. A native image has none of those. Three
 * real defects in this repo were invisible to the entire suite and fatal to the binary, and all
 * three are covered below:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a shipped datasource default that only the packaged process ever meets — historically
 *       {@code AUTO_SERVER=TRUE} on the H2 urls, which asked for {@code org.h2.server.TcpServer}, a
 *       class no native image has, and killed the process in connection-pool warm-up before it
 *       bound a port. The urls are {@code ${QITS_RESOURCE_*_URL}} expressions now, with no feature
 *       left in them to lose; what is under test is that the indirection itself resolves, so
 *       <em>any</em> assertion against a running server catches a jar that spells a variable
 *       wrong.
 *   <li>{@code project-template/} not being in the image, so project creation — the first thing
 *       anyone does with this service — failed with "missing from the classpath". {@code
 *       repository-template/} is the second such tree and is covered the same way, by creating a
 *       blank repository.
 *   <li>{@code RepositoryMetadata} unregistered for reflection, so startup discovery could not read
 *       a sidecar it had itself written.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code src/test/resources/application.properties} points the launched process at {@code
 * target/} through {@code quarkus.test.arg-line}; without that this test would write into the
 * developer's real {@code ~/.qits}. The two databases cannot travel that way — their urls name a
 * port chosen at run time — so {@link PackagedResources} hands them over instead.
 *
 * <p>ITs are skipped by default ({@code skipITs} in the root pom) and the {@code native} profile
 * flips that, so {@code ./mvnw verify -Dnative} is what runs this. {@code -DskipITs=false} runs it
 * against the fast-jar.
 *
 * <p>{@code creatingAProjectSeedsTheWrapperFromTheTemplate} and {@code
 * theRemoteLoginSocketRunsARealTerminal} both publish to the git host — {@code
 * GitHostRepositories.ensure} plus a real push — and the packaged binary wires the shipped {@code
 * HttpGitHostRepositories}/{@code ConfiguredGitHostAddress}, not the {@code Fake*} CDI doubles
 * {@code domain}'s and this module's own {@code @QuarkusTest}s use (those win only inside the JVM
 * that starts them, and this test starts a separate process). {@link GitHostFixture} is that
 * process' stand-in for qits-githost: a real HTTP server in this JVM, handed to the launched
 * process as {@code qits.githost.url}.

   * Hands the launched artifact its three databases the way a deployment does — as the generic
   * resource triples {@code QITS_RESOURCE_DB_*}, {@code QITS_RESOURCE_EPICS_*} and {@code
   * QITS_RESOURCE_EVENTSTREAM_*}, not as the {@code quarkus.datasource.*} keys. The domain, epics
   * and qits-eventstream jars ship {@code jdbc.url=${QITS_RESOURCE_DB_URL}} and its two siblings, so
   * supplying the variables leaves the <b>shipped</b> expressions themselves under test. These
   * overrides reach the launched process as system properties, and expression expansion reads the
   * whole config, so the same nine names resolve there.
   *
   * <p>The third triple is not optional and is the whole reason this javadoc changed: the bus jar is
   * dark outside a deployment, and dark stops publishing and dialling rather than connecting — so a
   * packaged process handed no eventstream url dies at Flyway naming the missing variable, which is
   * exactly the refuse-to-boot stance this IT exists to keep honest.
   *
   * <p>The databases are on an embedded postgres this JVM starts. <b>Their urls travel through
   * system properties rather than static fields</b>: a test profile is instantiated in more than
   * one classloader, so a field written by one copy is not the field the other reads, while the
   * process has exactly one property table.
