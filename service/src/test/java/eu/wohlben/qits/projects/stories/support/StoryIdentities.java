/**
 * The two identity tracks qits-projects accepts, one helper each — because a story that presented
 * the wrong one would be documenting a door that does not exist.
 *
 * <h2>A machine is a bearer</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #platformService(RequestSpecification)} presents an RS256 token minted by {@link
 * MockIdp} against the very JWKS the launched process fetches when a bearer first arrives: {@code
 * aud=qits-platform} (what {@code quarkus.oidc.token.audience} pins as a literal in
 * {@code application.properties} — the one audience qits-idp puts on every token it mints) and
 * {@code groups=[qits:system]} — qits-idp copies a client's
 * roles into that claim and quarkus-oidc reads it as roles with no configuration at all.
 *
 * <h2>A person is a pair of headers</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link #person(RequestSpecification, String)} sends {@code X-Qits-User} and {@code
 * X-Qits-Roles} instead, which is what the platform edge asserts for a logged-in human: this
 * service authenticates no person itself, and the edge strips every client-supplied {@code
 * X-Qits-*} header from every inbound request, which is the entire reason a header can be trusted
 * as an identity here. That is not a shortcut around the bearer — the OIDC tenant is
 * {@code application-type=service}, i.e. <b>bearer-only</b>, so a request carrying no {@code
 * Authorization} header is never challenged by it and falls through to the header mechanism exactly
 * as it does behind the edge. Using it is what makes a story say "a product owner" honestly rather
 * than dressing a person up as a machine.
 *
 * <p><b>The synthetic {@code %test} dev user is not available here, and that is the point.</b>
 * {@code qits.auth.forward.dev-user} is {@code %test}-scoped, and a launched artifact runs in
 * {@code NORMAL} mode — so an anonymous request really is anonymous and the roles below are the
 * only thing opening these doors. Every refusal in {@code stories.refusals} is a claim only a
 * packaged run can make: inside a {@code @QuarkusTest} the dev identity holds all four platform
 * roles and no route here would refuse anybody.
