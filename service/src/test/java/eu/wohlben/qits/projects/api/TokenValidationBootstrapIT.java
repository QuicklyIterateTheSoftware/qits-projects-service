/**
 * The whole service as it is <b>packaged</b> — like {@link PackagedSurfaceIT} beside it, but with
 * the OIDC tenant <b>on</b>, which no {@code @QuarkusTest} here can prove: the shipped tenant is
 * gated behind {@code qits.auth.machine.required} and every suite in this repository leaves that
 * gate shut, so the {@code quarkus.oidc.*} block this service actually deploys with
 * (auth-server-url + jwks-path against a real listener, audience enforcement, the {@code groups}
 * claim becoming roles) is exercised nowhere else. The far side is {@link MockIdp}, whose
 * recordings make the interaction assertable on <b>both ends</b>.
 *
 * <p>It is also this repo's <b>first userflow</b>, and the one every other story class in
 * {@code stories/} is ordered after: the proof doubles as documentation, emitted under {@code
 * target/userstories/} with a network diagram beside the steps. The diagram is <b>observed, never
 * narrated</b> — the framework's shipped {@link NetworkTaps#restAssured(String) RestAssured tap}
 * draws what a story sends into this service, {@link MockIdp}'s recordings supply what this service
 * sent to the idp, and the framework drains both at story end. A story method therefore asserts and
 * notes; it draws nothing. The story is browserless (no {@code Flow} parameter), so no Chromium is
 * involved anywhere.
 *
 * <p><b>The two stories are ordered</b>, and that is load-bearing rather than tidiness. The subject
 * of the first story is that the JWKS fetch happens when the <b>first bearer</b> arrives and not
 * before, so only the story that presents the first bearer of the whole run can state the negative
 * half of it; a second story that got there first would fetch the keys and leave this one asserting
 * nothing. The same reasoning is why this class runs before every other — it owns the first bearer
 * and the one fetch that follows it — and the story classes under {@code stories/} declare
 * {@code @UserflowRunsAfter(TokenValidationBootstrapIT)} so that stays true however the packages are
 * later renamed. The attribution machinery cares too: a cumulative source is drained by a cursor, so
 * the fetch lands in whichever story drains after it was recorded, and the order is what keeps that
 * the story it belongs to.
 *
 * <p><b>ITs are skipped by default here and this one does NOT flip that</b>, unlike qits-githost's
 * namesake. {@code skipITs} is {@code true} in the root pom because {@link PackagedSurfaceIT} is
 * the repository's other IT and it is heavyweight — real git pushes through a CGI fixture and a
 * pseudo-terminal — so opting the module back in globally would drag that into every {@code mvn
 * verify}. {@code .config/qits/ci-event-userflows.yml} names this class instead
 * ({@code -DskipITs=false "-Dit.test=TokenValidationBootstrapIT"}), which is also what keeps the
 * userflow pipeline about this story and nothing else.

   * repositories had each hand-copied. Its default skip is any path carrying a {@code /q/} segment,
   * which is right for this service: {@code quarkus.http.non-application-root-path} is {@code
   * /projects/q}, so the readiness probe below is out of every diagram and no route this service
   * owns is. It is idempotent per service, so a story class installing it again draws nothing
   * twice.
   *
   * <p>The idp is the far side, registered as a <b>cumulative</b> source: the supplier hands over
   * the mock's whole request log every time it is asked and the framework remembers how much of it
   * earlier stories already consumed, so the key fetch — driven by the first story's own bearer — is
   * attributed to that story and to that one only. It is invoked lazily at story end, so registering
   * it here is safe even though nothing has been recorded yet.
   *
   * <p>The label carries the status the mock <i>answered</i> with, which is the half a method and
   * path cannot supply: {@code "GET /idp/jwks -> 200"} is evidence that the keys were served, not
   * merely asked for.
   *
   * <p><b>One route is deliberately excluded, and it is the cached-read exclusion.</b> {@code POST
   * /idp/token} is this process fetching its own machine credential for qits-githost —
   * {@code client_credentials}, cached by quarkus-oidc-client for the token's whole hour, so it
   * happens <b>exactly once per run</b>. Which story pays for it is therefore a stopwatch question
   * rather than a fact about that story: whichever one first publishes to the git host draws an
   * arrow the identical story would not draw if it ran second, and the {@code networkHash} moves
   * with nothing having changed. What every story that publishes <em>does</em> carry is the git
   * host traffic itself, which is the evidence that the credential worked. The dependency is not
   * lost, only kept out of the per-story diagrams: it is stated in AGENTS.md and it is
   * {@code stubTheGitHostTokenEndpoint} above that makes it exist at all.
