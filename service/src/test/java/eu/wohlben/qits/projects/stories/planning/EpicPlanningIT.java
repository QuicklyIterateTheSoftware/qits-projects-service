/**
 * <b>The planning surface</b> — an epic proposed, its scope frozen, and then its work marked done.
 *
 * <p>This is the half of qits-projects the refinement agents and the epics board live on, and its
 * one rule is worth stating before the stories: <b>the freeze is per field, not per endpoint</b>.
 * A structural change — the epic's title or description, and any feature or task create, update or
 * delete — needs the epic at {@code REPORTED}; the implemented markers need it at {@code
 * READY_FOR_DEV} or {@code IMPLEMENTING} — which is why the owner's own press schedules the epic
 * before the engineer ever reaches for a marker. So the same {@code PUT /tasks/{id}} is refused
 * before the freeze and accepted after the scope is frozen and scheduled, depending on which field
 * it carries, and the two stories below are exactly those two sides. Two gates stand in front of
 * the freeze and the schedule: {@code ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA} (an epic needs criteria to enter
 * {@code REFINED}) and {@code PERSON_APPROVAL} (only a verified person may schedule it, {@code
 * REFINED -> READY_FOR_DEV}).
 *
 * <p><b>Two actors, because it really is two people.</b> A product owner shapes and freezes the
 * scope; an engineer marks the work done afterwards and never touches the scope. The audit log is
 * what keeps them apart — every row records the {@code X-Qits-User} the edge asserted, which is the
 * only thing that ever produces a principal in a deployed process — and the second story reads it
 * back rather than taking the write's word for it.
 *
 * <p><b>The network claim is a negative one and it is the interesting one.</b> Nothing on this
 * surface leaves the process: no git host, no orchestrator, no idp. The plan is rows in this
 * service's own {@code epics} database, and {@code assertOnlyEdgesFrom} naming one person is what
 * says so. Contrast {@link ProjectCatalogueIT}, where every write publishes to the git host.

      A product owner drafts an epic against a project, gives it a feature, and gives that feature
      a task bound to one of the project's repositories — a task must name a repository in its own
      epic's project, so the plan and the catalogue are one graph rather than two. The epic starts
      REPORTED, which is the only status in which any of that is allowed, and the transition door
      is the only thing that moves it. REFINED is the scope freeze, and it is refused — 409, naming
      the ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA gate — until the epic has acceptance criteria, so the owner gives it
      some first. Afterwards the same person, on the same session, cannot add a second feature — 409,
      because the scope is no longer a draft, and that is a conflict rather than a permission
      problem. Scheduling the epic for development (REFINED -> READY_FOR_DEV) is a separate, later
      decision — the PERSON_APPROVAL gate — and the owner's own press is what makes it one.
