 * answer carries <em>this process's</em> value — which the agent half reads out of config, because
 * that image is still configuration-driven, and the refinement half takes from the pinned
 * dependency's constant, because that one is not. The <b>image</b> halves are literals, because the
 * registry-relative spelling is the contract while the configured value is fully qualified.
 *
 * <p>The omission rules are exercised against {@link PinsController#pins} directly: a blank version
 * is a config state, and reaching it through a {@code @TestProfile} would cost a Quarkus restart to
 * prove four lines of string handling.
