/**
 * The suite's {@link ReleaseExecutor}: records what a READY request asked for and answers what the
 * test scripted. An ordinary bean over the {@code @DefaultBean} {@link GitHostReleaseExecutor}, so
 * it wins the injection simply by existing; state through methods, the package convention.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link #passThrough()} is the exception that makes the whole flow assertable.</b> Winning
 * the injection is what lets every state-machine test script an outcome without a git host — and it
 * is also what would leave the real executor reachable by nothing but a direct call, with {@code
 * ReleaseRequests}' half of the release (the pending-merge row, RELEASED, the siblings' re-fold)
 * never proved to run behind it. So the fake can delegate: the real executor is injected by its own
 * type, past its {@code @DefaultBean}, and a test that wants the whole chain turns it on. The
 * recording still happens, so the ask is assertable either way.
