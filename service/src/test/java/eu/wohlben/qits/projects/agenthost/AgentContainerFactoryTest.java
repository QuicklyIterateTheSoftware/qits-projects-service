/**
 * What a project-agent container is actually started with — the request qits-containers is handed.
 *
 * <p>A {@code @QuarkusTest} rather than a hand-built factory, deliberately: half of what is asserted
 * here is the <b>shipped configuration</b> — the image name, the API token, the git base, the shared
 * volume names — and a hand-built instance would prove those against values the test itself chose.
 * The spec this asserts is the spec a deployment sends.
 *
 * <p>The env block is the sharp end. Every {@code QITS_PROJECTS_DAEMON_*} name is read from the
 * daemon repo's own AGENTS.md "Environment" table, and getting one wrong fails <em>silently</em> — a
 * daemon with no url stays idle and the container simply never dials home, a daemon with no token
 * does not bind its API and every proxied request 502s. Nothing at build time on either side
 * notices, so this test is the notice.
 *
 * <p>The sandbox is the other. Two flags are deliberately <b>off</b> here that are on for a CI step
 * container, and a refactor that turned them on would break the toolchain this image exists to
 * carry — so their absence is asserted as hard as the limits' presence.
