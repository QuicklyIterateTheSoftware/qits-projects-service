/**

 *
 * <p><b>This process holds no docker socket and spawns no process.</b> Every line of docker
 * vocabulary that used to live in {@code DockerAgentRuntime} — {@code run}, {@code start},
 * {@code stop}, {@code ps}, {@code volume create}, {@code network inspect}/{@code create} — is one
 * call to the orchestrator, which owns the daemon. The network went further than that: it is the
 * bootstrap's to create, so this class does not ensure one and has no startup observer at all.
 *
 * <p><b>The client never throws, and its four answers are what every decision here is made on.</b> A
 * refusal and an unreachable service mean opposite things — one is evidence about the request, the
 * other about nothing at all — so a method that collapsed them would report "there is no container"
 * for "nobody answered", and the ladder would provision a second one. Do not add a fifth outcome by
 * catching something.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code @DefaultBean}.</b> It yields to any other bean of the type, which is what lets the
 * suite install {@code FakeContainerRuntime} and reach no orchestrator — the same arrangement
 * {@code ConfiguredGitHostAddress} has, and the same one {@code DockerAgentRuntime} had. Keep the
 * annotation: dropping it makes the two an ambiguous dependency and the build fails at
 * {@code ArcProcessor#validate}, for every test at once.
