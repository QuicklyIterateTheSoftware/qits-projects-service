/**
 * <b>The release.</b> A gated release request arrives here and leaves as a tag on qits-githost.
 *
 * <p>This is what replaced the qits-workspaces release door on 2026-09-03, and the shape of the
 * flow changed with the caller: that door merged a branch into {@code main}, bumped, committed,
 * pushed, tagged and promoted onto a deploy branch — one operation whose every step wrote a ref
 * somebody else's CI was watching. <b>A release is a tag now.</b> {@code main} is finalized after
 * the deployment, by a later arm of this epic; what happens here is the smallest thing that can be
 * called a release:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Stamp</b> a calver, {@link VersionStamp} — {@code YYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS}, UTC, once per
 *       attempt and threaded through, because a slow bump would otherwise write two versions into
 *       one commit.
 *   <li><b>Bump</b> the manifests, {@link ManifestVersionBump} — read the fold's tree and its poms
 *       and package.jsons through {@link ReleaseGitHost}, splice the version into them, and hand
 *       back the new bytes. There is no worktree on this side: the fold exists only on the git host.
 *   <li><b>Commit</b> them onto the backing branch. This is the last commit before the tag and its
 *       sha is what gets tagged. A repository that renders no version commits nothing and tags the
 *       fold itself, which is a release like any other — except the project's WRAPPER, whose
 *       release also <b>banks the estate</b>: every declared submodule pinned as a gitlink at its
 *       default branch's head, in this same commit ({@link #bankGitlinks}).
 *   <li><b>Tag</b> that commit with the version. A {@code 409 tag-exists} is <b>the platform's
 *       version-uniqueness guarantee</b>, not an error: somebody released that second already, so
 *       the whole attempt starts again with a fresh stamp. Bounded at {@link #ATTEMPTS}, because a
 *       name that stays taken past three seconds is not a same-second tie.
 *   <li><b>Delete</b> the branches the release consumed — the named sources and the backing branch
 *       — best effort, because by now the tag exists and nothing after it may pretend it does not.
 *       <b>Never the default branch</b>, which is stated by the caller rather than guessed at.
 *   <li><b>Announce</b> {@code SCMRelease}, over {@link ReleaseAnnouncer}, at the moment the tag was
 *       accepted. qits-projects is that event's publisher now; its payload is unchanged.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Recording the tag as pending a merge to {@code main}, and moving the request to RELEASED, are
 * deliberately <b>not</b> here: they are rows in this service's own database and belong to {@code
 * ReleaseRequests}, which calls this and settles what comes back.
 *
 * <p><b>Never throws, and every failure is classified.</b> {@code retryable} is the port's word for
 * "the moment failed" — an unreachable git host, a 5xx, a ref that moved under us, a tag name that
 * stayed taken — and the sweep retries exactly those. A manifest that will not parse, a backing
 * branch that is gone and a rev that does not resolve answer the same forever and are refusals about
 * the ask, which the sweep leaves standing until a re-arm changes it.
 *
 * <p><b>Where the retry restarts is the whole of the tag-exists arm.</b> A fresh attempt re-reads
 * the tree at the tip the previous attempt left behind and re-bumps it to the new version, rather
 * than re-tagging the same commit under another name: the manifests inside the commit have to carry
 * the version the tag says, or the released artifacts would name a version nothing built.
