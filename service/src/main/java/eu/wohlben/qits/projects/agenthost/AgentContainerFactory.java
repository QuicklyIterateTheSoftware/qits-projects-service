/**
 * The whole of what a project-agent container is started with, as the orchestrator's wire spells it.
 * Routing all creation through {@link #forProject} makes it structurally impossible to start an
 * agent without the shared credential volume, the checkout volume, the docker-host alias, the host
 * uid, the daemon's dial-home identity and — where a deployment has an idp — the container's own
 * commissioned platform credential.
 *
 * <p><b>The two arms differ about that credential and about nothing else new.</b>
 * {@link #forProject} commissions one, {@link #forRestart} reads back the one the container already
 * holds; {@link AgentCommissions} carries why those are two different questions and why a wake that
 * asked for a fresh pair would stop being a start in place.
 *
 * <p><b>It builds an {@link EnsureRequest} and no argv.</b> The {@code docker run} argv builder this
 * class used to render into was deleted with the docker runtime: this service spawns no process, so
 * the cheapest process library is no process library. Every field below lands in the same place it
 * landed as a flag, on the far side of one HTTP call.
 *
 * <p><b>The shared volumes are shared platform-wide on purpose</b>, and they are {@link SharedMount}s
 * rather than {@link VolumeMount}s, which is the wire saying exactly that: a shared mount is the
 * platform's and is never claimed, created or removed on this workload's behalf. The credential
 * volume and the two build caches carry the same names qits-workspaces uses, so a one-time
 * {@code claude} login and a dependency downloaded by any container are seen by every other one.
 * Diverging the names here would give a project agent its own unauthenticated agent home.
 *
 * <p><b>It also carries what the container's sessions are configured to run as.</b> The resolved
 * agent configuration document — every session surface, built from this service's own store in
 * process — goes in as {@link #AGENT_CONFIGURATION_ENV} beside the path the daemon is to put it at,
 * so a container is <em>born</em> knowing how {@code project.epics} and {@code project.tickets} are
 * steered rather than asking at launch. {@link #agentConfiguration()} carries the whole of why it is
 * env rather than the mounted file the epic specified, and what that costs.
 *
 * <p><b>The checkout is the one volume this workload owns.</b> {@code qits_project_<projectId>} is a
 * {@link VolumeMount}, so the orchestrator claims a row for it and creates it before the container
 * mounts it — and under {@code IDLE_STOP} it will not remove it even when asked, which is the
 * wire-level spelling of "nothing here discards a checkout".

   * The whole resolved agent configuration document, serialized — what a container is born with.
   *
   * <p>The two surfaces this container serves are {@code project.epics} and {@code project.tickets};
   * what goes in is <b>every</b> surface anyway, which is the container door's own decision and its
   * javadoc carries the argument (a container that turns out to serve a surface the creator did not
   * predict is better off holding a configuration for it than falling back to constants).
   *
   * <p><b>It is built here rather than fetched.</b> The store is in this service, so there is no hop
   * to make and no failure policy to write for one; this is the same code path {@code
   * AgentConfigurationController} answers with, one method along, so operator and container cannot
   * be told two different things.
   *
   * <p><b>It can fail, loudly, by design.</b> A surface attaching an external MCP server whose
   * qits-configuration credential does not resolve throws out of {@code document()} naming the key
   * and the surface — and that failure is allowed to reach {@code AgentContainers.ensure}, which
   * reports the container {@code FAILED} with the reason on {@code failureDetail}. That is the right
   * end of the trade here and it differs from qits-workspaces' on purpose: over there the document
   * arrives over the network from a peer that can simply be down, so refusing to create the
   * workspace would trade a configuration outage for a work outage. Here the build reaches a
   * database this service already cannot run without, and the one way it fails is a catalog entry
   * somebody attached with a credential that is not there — a configuration error a person made,
   * that a person can undo, and that would otherwise become an agent talking to a server that 401s
   * on its first tool call.
   *
   * <p><b>The bytes ride the environment because nothing can mount a file here.</b>
   * {@code ContainersWire.Spec} carries {@code volumeMounts} and {@code sharedMounts} and no way to
   * materialize host content, and this service holds no docker socket and writes nothing to the
   * docker host — so the mounted file the epic specified cannot be produced by either host that
   * creates a container. The daemon writes {@link #AGENT_CONFIGURATION_ENV} to {@link
   * #agentConfigurationPath} at boot and hands the library that path, which keeps every decision the
   * epic made and moves only the transport. {@code AgentConfigurationDocumentDto}'s javadoc carries
   * the full argument and the cost.
   *
   * <p><b>Stamped with the store's last change, not with now</b> — {@code
   * documentForContainerSpec()} — because these bytes are hashed into the spec and a wall clock in
   * there would turn every wake into a container replacement. Which is also the mechanism the epic's
   * "recreate only" reach is made of, from the other side: an edit changes these bytes, so the next
   * wake's {@code Recreate.ifChanged} replaces the container and the edit takes effect. Nothing
   * pushes, nothing polls, and there is no staleness flag.
