/**
 * Stops project-agent containers nobody is using.
 *
 * <p>An agent container is expensive — the whole workspace toolchain, a checkout, and a JVM's worth
 * of daemon — and it is started on the first open of a refinement panel, which means it is started
 * far more often than anyone remembers to stop it. So the harness has two ways down: the explicit
 * Stop verb, and this.
 *
 * <p><b>It stops, and never removes.</b> The {@code /workspace} volume survives whatever happens to
 * the container after it, so the next ensure reattaches the same checkout with its submodules, its
 * build caches and any uncommitted work intact. Nothing here discards work, which is what makes an
 * automatic sweep safe to run at all.
 *
 * <p><b>What counts as activity</b> is anything the daemon says: its {@code Hello}, its heartbeat,
 * and every agent lifecycle report. A container whose agent is running a long silent build still
 * heartbeats, so the window measures "nobody is using this project", not "nothing is happening".
 * The host also stamps a container when it starts one, so a fresh container gets the full window to
 * dial home in rather than being reaped for having said nothing yet.
 *
 * <p><b>That is one question, and {@link AgentStaleImageSweep} answers the other.</b> Because the
 * heartbeat counts here, this window does not elapse on a running container — which is right for
 * "nobody is using this project" and useless for "this container is running an image nobody gated".
 * The second sweep reads a second stamp, on a shorter window, and the two are deliberately not
 * folded together: see its class javadoc.
 *
 * <p><b>A container this process has never heard of is stamped on sight</b> rather than reaped or
 * made immortal — one whose daemon has never connected, or that outlived a restart of this service.
 * It then ages out normally, one window later.
 *
 * <p><b>It stays host-side, and the orchestrator's identical sweep does not replace it.</b> Stopping
 * a container is the smallest part of what happens here: the tunnel's loopback listener has to be
 * closed and the daemon registry entry forgotten, and both are in-memory state of <em>this</em>
 * process that qits-containers cannot reach. The spec still carries an {@code IDLE_STOP} policy with
 * the same window, as the belt for a qits-projects that died holding a container — and this sweep
 * {@link ContainerRuntime#touch}es what it keeps, so the belt cannot fire on a container somebody is
 * working in.
 *
 * <p><b>Which project a container belongs to is resolved here now.</b> It used to be read off the
 * {@code qits.project} label; the orchestrator's listing carries no label and no ref, so what comes
 * back is container names, and a name is matched against the live projects' own
 * {@code qits-proj-<slug>}. A container matching none of them is <b>skipped</b>: it belongs to a
 * deleted project, and every action this sweep takes past the stop — the tunnel, the registry entry
 * — is addressed by a project id there is no longer one of. Nothing else here would stop it either,
 * and a container a deleted project left behind is a leak the ensure ladder reports (409) rather
 * than one a sweep should quietly act on.
