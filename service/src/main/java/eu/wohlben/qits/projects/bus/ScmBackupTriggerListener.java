/**
 * The git host said a repository's refs moved, so its forge twin is out of date: schedule a backup.
 *
 * <p>This replaces {@code api/GitHostEventController}, a {@code POST /projects/api/events/
 * post-receive} the git host called out of its own hook. The route is gone, and so is the shape it
 * had — one fire-and-forget HTTP call per push, in the critical path of somebody's {@code git push},
 * with a service restart or a moment of unreachability costing a backup silently. What replaced it
 * is a durable consumption: the claim and the schedule commit together, and a push that landed while
 * this process was away is read back off the log by the catch-up sweep rather than lost.
 *
 * <h2>All four events, and every one of them owed a backup</h2>
 *
 * <p>The vocabulary is the git host's {@code githost-events} jar and it has four records. Each one
 * says the same thing to <em>this</em> service: refs in {@code repoId} are not what the twin holds.
 * So all four map to the one call, and the mapping is deliberately total rather than clever.
 *
 * <p><b>Deletions and tags now trigger a backup, and they never did before</b> — that is a fix, not
 * a side effect of the migration. The old hook fanned out branch <em>updates</em> only, so pushing a
 * tag left the twin without it until the hourly sweep happened to notice. <b>A deletion does not
 * reach the twin through here, though:</b> the backup pushes {@code refs/heads/*} and {@code
 * refs/tags/*} without {@code --prune} and never pushes a deletion at all — a twin that mirrored
 * every deletion would mirror a mistaken one too. A deletion event still schedules a backup, which
 * then carries nothing new. Release tags are decommissioned on the host and the twin together by
 * the GC's {@code tags.sweep} ({@code control/TagCollector}, behind {@code POST
 * /projects/api/gc/tags}); a deleted branch stays on the twin.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code suppressCi} is ignored, deliberately.</b> That flag on {@link SCMPublishCommit}
 * carries {@code -o qits.no-ci} — a statement about whether a <em>build</em> should run, which is
 * qits-ci's question. An imported upstream's history is exactly the case: it must not fire a build
 * per branch, and it must absolutely be backed up. Reading the flag here would make the one push
 * that most needs a twin the one push that never gets one.
 *
 * <h2>Debounce and sweep, both kept</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link BackupPushService#onPush} is unchanged and still absorbs a burst into one run, which
 * matters more here than it did on the hook: one {@code git push} of several branches and a tag is
 * now several <em>events</em>, and a catch-up sweep can deliver a whole disconnect window at once.
 * {@code startup/ScheduledBackupSweep} stays too. Durable delivery narrows what the sweep is for
 * without emptying it — an unreachable forge, an expired credential and a backup that failed for its
 * own reasons are none of them missing events, and the sweep is the only thing that fixes them.
 *
 * <h2>Failure, and why nothing here throws</h2>
 *
 * <p>The seam's rule is that a throw rolls the claim back and offers the event again forever, so a
 * handler must decide per failure whether a later attempt could do better. This one has no such
 * case: {@code onPush} returns immediately and always, swallowing every backup failure by design,
 * and the only thing that can go wrong on this thread is a payload that will not parse or names no
 * repository. The same bytes would fail identically every time, so both are the poison case — a WARN
 * and a return, never a wedged watermark.
