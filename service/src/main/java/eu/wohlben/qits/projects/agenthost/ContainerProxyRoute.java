/**
 * The project-agent reverse proxy: {@code /projects/container/{projectId}/*} forwards verbatim to
 * that project's in-container {@code qits-projects-daemon}. A copy of qits-workspaces'
 * {@code ContainerProxyRoute}, with its one branch removed.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the only way to reach a daemon.</b> Its HTTP API — the commands surface, the coding
 * agent surface and the two interactive websockets — binds {@code 127.0.0.1} from capability 1 and
 * has no address on {@code qits-net} at all. So unlike the reference there is <em>no</em> direct
 * branch: the reverse tunnel is the whole transport, and a project with no live daemon is answered
 * as unreachable rather than dialled at a container name that would refuse the connection anyway.
 *
 * <p><b>Verbatim means verbatim: this route rewrites no path.</b> The daemon receives {@code
 * /projects/container/{projectId}/commands}, not {@code /commands}, and is <em>configured</em> to
 * know that leading part is its own address — {@code deskhost/FrontDeskSpecs} injects {@link
 * ContainerProxyPath#base} as {@code QITS_PROJECTS_DAEMON_API_BASE_PATH} at container creation.
 * That is a deliberate rule rather than an inherited shape: a hop that rewrites a path leaves the
 * two ends disagreeing about the destination's own address, and the disagreement shows up in
 * redirects, generated links and logs, a long way from the rewrite. Stripping here would also have
 * to be done twice — the upgrade path takes the URI straight off the inbound request — so the
 * rewrite that looks like one line is two.
 *
 * <p><b>An upgrade takes a different road through this class, and that is deliberate.</b> {@code WS
 * /terminal/commands/{id}} and {@code WS /chat/commands/{id}} are proxied by {@link #proxyUpgrade}
 * rather than by {@code vertx-http-proxy}, because the library's upgrade path skips its own
 * interceptor chain <em>and</em> pipes the socket with no flow control whatsoever. That method
 * carries the measurement.
 *
 * <p><b>Two interceptors on the ordinary path, and the reason each is there.</b> The bearer is
 * added here rather than being anything the caller supplies — it is peer authentication between
 * qits and the container, so a caller-supplied one would be meaningless and a forwarded one would
 * be a credential leak. The host rewrite pins the authority the daemon sees to a constant, so it
 * does not change under the daemon when the origin does — which is exactly what an ephemeral
 * loopback tunnel port does on every reconnect. The upgrade path arranges both for itself, one
 * mechanism per path.
 *
 * <p>Security posture, stated plainly because it is easy to overstate: this route scopes a request
 * to a project with a live daemon and forwards it. It does not authorize the caller, because there
 * is no owner to authorize against — qits is single-user.
