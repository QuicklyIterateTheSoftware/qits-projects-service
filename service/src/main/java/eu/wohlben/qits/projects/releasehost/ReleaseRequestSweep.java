/**
 * The safety net under the event-driven release requests: re-evaluates every open request on a
 * schedule, which is what turns "qits-ci could not be asked", "the verdict had not landed yet" and a
 * FAILED execution into delays instead of stalls. Since the gate passes on a green verdict and
 * nothing else, it is also the only thing that will ever release a request whose verdict arrived
 * while this service was down.
 *
 * <p>quarkus-scheduler rides in with the eventstream jar, so this costs the deployable nothing new.
 * The interval is {@code qits.projects.release-requests.sweep-every}; the suite turns it {@code
 * off} in {@code %test} (the same darkness idiom as the bus), because a tick landing mid-test would
 * execute a request a test was still staging.
