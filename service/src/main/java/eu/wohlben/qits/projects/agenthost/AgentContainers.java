/**
 * The project-agent lifecycle: the ensure ladder, the stop verb, and the read behind all three REST
 * routes. Adapted from the ladder qits-workspaces runs inside {@code ensureContainer}.
 *
 * <h2>The ladder</h2>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Running</b> — no-op, plus a stamp. The container is up and its {@code /workspace} is
 *       whatever the last session left there.
 *   <li><b>Present but not running</b> — {@link ContainerRuntime#restart}. Lossless: the checkout,
 *       its submodules and any uncommitted work live on a named volume nothing here removes, which
 *       is the whole reason the stop policy never discards one.
 *   <li><b>Absent</b> — provision. The daemon self-clones the wrapper into the volume on boot; the
 *       host awaits none of it, because a browser opening a refinement panel should not block on a
 *       clone.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>Two arms, not three, once you look at what they send.</b> Both the second and the third are
 * one {@code ensure} to qits-containers; what differs is that the second asks for the container to
 * be replaced and the third does not. There is no start verb on that service's wire, and
 * {@link ContainerRuntime#restart} carries the whole argument.
 *
 * <p><b>Synchronous, and serialized per project.</b> Two concurrent ensures would race into two
 * bring-ups of the same place, and the second would either replace what the first had just started
 * or be refused on the name — a failure that reads like a bug in the ladder rather than like two
 * clicks. A per-project lock removes it, and a caller that arrives while the lock is held sees
 * {@link AgentRuntimeStatus#PROVISIONING} rather than queueing behind an image pull.
 *
 * <p><b>Ownership is the registry's now, not a label's.</b> A place is addressed
 * {@code owner/project-agent/<projectId>}, so a row found under this project's id <em>is</em> this
 * project's and no read has to prove it. What the label used to catch survives one arm down: a
 * project deleted without its agent being removed leaves the container <em>name</em> — derived from
 * a slug, which is unique among live projects only — sitting there for whoever takes the freed slug
 * next, and the provisioning arm refuses that with a 409 rather than adopting it.
