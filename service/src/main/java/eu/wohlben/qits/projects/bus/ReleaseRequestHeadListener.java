/**
 * A branch moved, so <b>every open release request that names it as a source</b> re-folds onto its
 * own backing branch — the merge-request shape generalised to N participants: pushing a fix onto a
 * rejected request is still the ordinary way to answer it, and a source that outran a pending gate
 * must invalidate it rather than be silently released. A push to {@code main} therefore touches
 * every open request of the repository, and each is folded separately: a shared trigger is never a
 * shared merge. A branch <b>deleted</b> is dropped from the requests naming it, and one left with
 * nothing but the default branch is withdrawn: there is no work in it any more and the row would
 * otherwise stand open forever (three did, 2026-09-01).
 *
 * <p>A push to the <b>default branch</b> is also news about {@code main}: every pending released tag
 * the new head contains leaves the implicit source set ({@code ReleaseRequests#onMainMoved}), which
 * is how a tag carried there by hand stops being folded in.
 *
 * <p><b>This is the whole of how a push reaches the release flow.</b> The git host's merge primitive
 * fires no {@code post-receive}, so a backing branch's own movement never comes back here — which is
 * what keeps the loop from feeding itself, and why finalization's own merge to {@code main} asks the
 * same question directly instead of waiting for an event that never comes.
 *
 * <p>Its own durable consumer beside {@link ScmBackupTriggerListener} rather than a second concern
 * inside it: the backup consumption is total over all four SCM events and must never learn release
 * semantics, and the two keep separate watermarks so one's poison cannot hold the other's.
 *
 * <p>{@code suppressCi} is deliberately ignored, the backup listener's reasoning pointed at gates:
 * a no-ci push still moves the head, so the request must still re-fold and re-arm — its gate then
 * passes through the settle window, because no verdict is coming. Reading the flag here would let a
 * no-ci push land commits nothing re-gated.
 *
 * <p>Failure policy is the seam's: an unreadable payload or one naming no {@code (repoId, branch,
 * sha)} is poison — WARN and settle; a database that could not answer is left to throw.
