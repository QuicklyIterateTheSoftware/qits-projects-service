/**
 * The release requests: the asynchronous ask that replaces calling the release door blind. A
 * request is an <b>octopus merge of N sources</b> — {@code main}, the branches somebody put on it,
 * and the repository's released tags not yet merged to {@code main} — folded onto {@code
 * release/<id>}; it is created PENDING, the build gate settles it off the commit ledger against the
 * merged sha, and the execution arm performs the release once it is READY. See {@code
 * control/ReleaseRequests} for the state machine, which this controller only fronts.
 *
 * <p><b>Named sources are caller-managed; implicit ones are not.</b> A create names one branch and
 * implies {@code main}; {@code POST …/{requestId}/sources} adds more. The released tags are derived
 * from what the repository has in flight, are reported in every read, and cannot be added or dropped
 * — an API that let a caller drop one would let somebody release a step backwards from what is
 * already shipping.
 *
 * <p><b>Priority is a property of a participating branch, not of the request.</b> It is declared
 * when the branch is put on ({@code priority} on the create and the add-source bodies, {@code
 * MEDIUM} where nobody says) and re-stated afterwards through {@code …/sources/priority}; what the
 * request answers with is the max over its named branches. Nothing acts on it yet — it is carried
 * down the chain as data for the queue-ordering feature to read.
 *
 * <p><b>Two reads hang off a single request and neither is a column.</b> {@code …/commits} is the
 * fold's own range, read out of the repository's mirror, and {@code …/artifacts} is what the
 * released tag's tree declares was published. Both exist because "the release landed" is the
 * beginning of a person's question rather than the end of it, and both answer 200 with a sentence
 * where they cannot answer with a list — see their operations below.
 *
 * <p><b>Two callers, two roles, on every route</b>: a person driving a release from a browser, and
 * the machine peers the door split brings (qits-workspaces creating requests on behalf of its
 * callers, the train's scripts). A method-level {@code @RolesAllowed} <b>replaces</b> the
 * class-level one, so both are spelled at the class and no method narrows it.

   *     actor is not an escalation.
   * @param priority how urgently the named branch wants to be released — {@code LOWEST}, {@code
   *     LOW}, {@code MEDIUM}, {@code HIGH}, {@code HIGHER} or {@code BLOCKING}. Optional: absent is
   *     {@code MEDIUM}, and a word naming no priority is a 400. It is stated <b>per branch</b>, so
   *     the implied {@code main} takes the default rather than this value. On the converge arm —
   *     asking again for a branch that already participates — an absent priority leaves the stored
   *     one alone, so a re-ask never downgrades an escalation.
