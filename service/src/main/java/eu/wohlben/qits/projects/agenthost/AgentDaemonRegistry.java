/**
 * The host's live-{@code qits-projects-daemon} directory: which projects have an open control
 * socket, keyed by {@code projectId}, plus the build stamp each one announced and when it was last
 * heard from. The in-JVM half of the control plane — {@link AgentControlSocket} owns the WebSocket
 * lifecycle and forwards frames here. Adapted from qits-workspaces' {@code
 * WorkspaceDaemonRegistry}, and much smaller than it.
 *
 * <h2>What was trimmed, and why each one has no caller here</h2>
 *
 * <p>The reference correlates {@code RunCommand}/{@code Describe} round-trips, drives bootstrap
 * chains and dev-server supervision, and rolls agent activity up per workspace. None of that
 * applies: the browser drives this daemon over its own HTTP API through the reverse tunnel, so
 * nothing on the host sends a {@code RunCommand}, and a project agent runs no services and no
 * bootstrap chain. The frames those replies would arrive on are handled defensively below and
 * dropped, because a daemon must never be able to break this socket by saying something unexpected.
 *
 * <p>What is kept is exactly what the host needs: the handshake, the build stamp (so the UI can say
 * which daemon build a container is on), a last-heard-from stamp (so the idle sweep can stop a
 * container nobody is using), the change nudges, and {@link #requestStream} — the reverse tunnel's
 * one outbound message.
