/**
 * A project's release requests, across every repository it owns — the one read that shows what is
 * waiting to be released without opening each repository in turn.
 *
 * <p><b>Why a route of its own rather than a query on the repository collection.</b> The
 * repository-scoped controller answers about one repository and is the machine peers' surface (the
 * door, the train). This is a person's overview: the scope is the project, the default is the
 * pending work — plus the handful that has just landed — rather than the whole history, and the rows
 * carry the repository's name because nothing else on the page says which repository a branch
 * belongs to.
 *
 * <p>The roles match {@code ReleaseRequestController}'s deliberately: reading a request tells you
 * what is being released and by whom, so the same two callers see it and no wider audience does.
 *
 * <p>An unknown project is a 404 rather than an empty list, the same reasoning the unknown-state
 * 400 in {@code ReleaseRequests} follows: on a page whose whole message is "nothing is pending
 * here", a mistyped scope must not be able to say it.
