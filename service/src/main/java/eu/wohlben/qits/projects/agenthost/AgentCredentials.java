/**
 * The commission API of qits-idp, as this harness needs it: a credential per agent container, given
 * back when the container ends.
 *
 * <p>The sole implementation is {@link eu.wohlben.qits.projects.idphost.IdpAgentCredentials}, which
 * is {@code @DefaultBean} — so the suite installs a double and reaches no idp, the same arrangement
 * {@code ContainerRuntime} has.
 *
 * <p><b>Absent is a supported configuration and it is the shipped one.</b> With
 * {@code quarkus.oidc-client.qits.client-enabled=false} this service holds no credential of its own,
 * so
 * it can authenticate to nothing and commissions nothing: {@link #enabled()} answers false, no HTTP
 * call is made, no environment is injected, and a container's spec is byte for byte the spec it was
 * before any of this existed. That is not a degraded mode — it is the deployment that has no idp,
 * and it must stay indistinguishable.
 *
 * <h2>The context</h2>
 *
 * <p>A commission names {@code (contextKind, contextId)}, and this harness's pair is
 * {@code (agent-container, <projectId>)}. The kind is the platform's word for what the credential
 * belongs to; the id is the project, because a place is {@code owner/project-agent/<projectId>} and
 * that id is the only name for a container that cannot go stale.

   * evaluated, so an agent reaches its own project's pipelines and nobody else's.
