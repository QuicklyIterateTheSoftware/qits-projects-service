/**
 * Hands back the credentials of agent containers that are gone.
 *
 * <p><b>This is where decommissioning actually happens, and that is a fact about this service rather
 * than a fallback.</b> A credential's lifetime is its container's, and nothing here removes a
 * container: the stop verb and the idle sweep both stop and never remove, deleting a project leaves
 * its container standing, and {@link ContainerRuntime} carries no removal verb at all. So the
 * lifecycle hook the model asks for has no call site — {@code AgentCommissions.forFreshContainer}
 * covers the one case this service can see (a project provisioning a replacement container), and
 * everything else is found here, by comparing what idp says this service commissioned against what
 * the orchestrator says exists.
 *
 * <p>It also closes the crash window that no hook could: a process that died between idp's write and
 * this database's leaves a commission no row names, and list-and-match finds it anyway.
 *
 * <h2>Why it asks per project instead of reading the listing</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link ContainerRuntime#listAgentContainers} answers an empty list both for "this owner has no
 * containers" and for "the orchestrator could not be asked" — a distinction its callers do not need
 * and this one cannot do without, because reaping on the second would revoke the credential of every
 * live agent at once. {@link ContainerRuntime#inspect} draws exactly the line that is needed: empty
 * is a place the orchestrator holds no row for, and anything else throws. It is also the only
 * question that can be asked at all here, since the listing's envelopes carry no ref and a
 * <em>deleted</em> project's container name cannot be derived from anything left.
 *
 * <p>One call per commissioned project, hourly. There are as many commissions as there are agent
 * containers, which is a handful.
 *
 * <p><b>A pass that cannot ask reaps nothing.</b> The first orchestrator failure ends the pass with a
 * warning; the next one comes round in an hour, and a credential that outlives its container by an
 * hour costs nothing the model has not already accepted for the token grace.
