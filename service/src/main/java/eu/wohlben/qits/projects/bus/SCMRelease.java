/**
 * <b>Source control has this release.</b> This version of this repository is tagged.
 *
 * <p><b>The publisher moved and the payload did not.</b> qits-workspaces announced this the instant
 * its release push was accepted, because only the process that ran {@code git push} knew atomically
 * that the push had succeeded and with which version. In the tag-only release flow there is no such
 * push: a release is a tag, asked for by <em>this</em> service through qits-githost's tag primitive,
 * and the equivalent moment is that primitive answering {@code 201}. So this record was a
 * <b>field-for-field replica</b> of {@code eu.wohlben.qits.workspaces.events.SCMRelease} — same
 * signature (the wire name is the simple class name), same five payload fields, same order. Every
 * existing consumer selects on those fields and none of them had to learn that the producer changed.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code commitSha} is the sixth, and it is ADDITIVE.</b> It is what the tag points at — the
 * version-bump commit, the same value {@code ReleaseExecutor.Outcome.released} carries and the same
 * one {@code ReleasedTagPendingMerge.releasedSha} records. It exists because the event was, until
 * now, the only release statement on the platform that could not be checked out: {@code branch} is
 * the backing branch and it is <em>deleted</em> at tag creation, and {@code version} names a tag but
 * no commit. A release pipeline reading this event therefore had to clone {@code main} and fetch the
 * tag by hand inside its own step script, and every one of its runs displayed as {@code main@<head>}
 * — a run recorded against a commit it did not build. With this field a CI trigger can declare
 * {@code checkout: { branch: version, sha: commitSha }} and the run is anchored where it belongs.
 *
 * <p><b>Additive means every older consumer is untouched and every older EVENT still works.</b> The
 * five fields keep their names, their types and their order; the new one is <b>nullable</b> and
 * {@code CanonicalJson}'s {@code NON_NULL} inclusion therefore omits it from the payload entirely
 * when it is absent, which is exactly the shape a replayed event from before this change has. A
 * consumer that resolves it and finds nothing must fall back to what it did before rather than
 * refuse — qits-ci's trigger engine does, and pins it.
 *
 * <p>It is nullable rather than required for one more reason: a repository that renders no version
 * at all is tagged at the fold itself, so there is always a commit to name, but an announcer is a
 * port and absence is a supported configuration everywhere in this service. A release must never
 * fail over a field.
 *
 * <p><b>It does not mean an artifact exists.</b> Nothing is built, published or installable at this
 * moment — that statement is qits-ci's {@code SoftwareRelease}, emitted once per artifact when a
 * repository's release pipeline goes green. Between the two sits that pipeline, which each
 * repository owns. A consumer reading this as "the package is in the registry" is reading it wrong,
 * and the gap it would race against is a whole upstream build. That gap is why the event is named
 * for the SCM.
 *
 * <p><b>There is no target field, deliberately.</b> {@code branch} is the <b>source</b> branch that
 * was released — here the release request's backing branch, {@code release/<id>}, which is what the
 * fold lives on and therefore what was released. A release no longer lands on the default branch at
 * all: {@code main} is finalized after the deployment.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code repositoryName} is what a committed selection can address, and {@code repository}
 * cannot.</b> A repository's row id is whatever its registry minted: for a repository the platform
 * manifest declares it happens to equal the name, but a repository registered by the projects
 * self-seed reconcile gets a UUID — minted per platform instance, different on every one. A CI
 * trigger matching {@code repository: { exact: qits-projects-daemon }} therefore matched nothing on
 * a platform where that repository is a UUID row, and matched silently: CI logs matches, never
 * non-matches, so those release pipelines simply never fired. The name is the stable coordinate, so
 * the event carries both — the id for anyone joining back to the registry, the name for anyone
 * selecting on it. Nullable: a repository with no alias costs the event a field, never the release.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code priority} is the seventh, and it is additive on exactly the same terms.</b> It is
 * what this release was worth to whoever asked for it — the max over the release request's named
 * branch sources, computed at release time so an escalation made while the request waited on its
 * gate still reaches the tag. A plain string ({@code LOWEST}, {@code LOW}, {@code MEDIUM}, {@code
 * HIGH}, {@code HIGHER}, {@code BLOCKING}), because no consumer of it is meant to hold a copy of
 * this service's enum, and nullable, so an older event and an announcer with nothing to say are the
 * same absent key. <b>It reorders nothing today</b>: qits-ci transcribes it and qits-deployments
 * records it, both display-only, and the queue-ordering feature is what will act on it.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code eventId} and {@code occurredAt} are components and stay out of the payload.</b> The
 * library's canonical serializer excludes everything {@link QitsEvent} declares, and these two
 * accessors are those declarations — so identity and time travel in the envelope and the payload is
 * exactly the fields {@code branch}, {@code commitSha}, {@code priority}, {@code projectId}, {@code
 * repository}, {@code repositoryName}, {@code version}. Reading a payload back therefore yields a fresh id and a
 * null time, which is correct: a received event's identity and clock are the envelope's.
 *
 * <p>It lives in {@code service/…/bus/} rather than a published vocabulary module, the {@link
 * RepositoryRenamed} ruling, and is registered in {@link EventWireReflection} — {@code CanonicalJson}
 * builds its own {@code ObjectMapper}, so an unregistered payload is every announcement dying inside
 * the publish on the native binary while the JVM suite stays green.
 *
 * @param projectId the project the repository belongs to, as qits-projects names it
 * @param repository the repository that released, by string id — never a reference into another
 *     context's tables
 * @param repositoryName the same repository by its registered name, the coordinate a committed CI
 *     selection can carry
 * @param branch the SOURCE branch that was released
 * @param version the release stamp, {@code YYYY.MMDD.HHMMSS} — also the name of the tag
 * @param commitSha what the tag points at, or null. <b>The coordinate that makes this event
 *     checkoutable</b>: {@code (version, commitSha)} is a tag name and the commit it peels to, which
 *     is a clone target where {@code branch} is a deleted ref and {@code version} alone is not a
 *     commit.
 * @param occurredAt when the tag was accepted, which is when the release happened
 * @param priority what this release was worth to whoever asked for it — the release request's
 *     effective priority at release time, or null. Inert data: it is recorded downstream and orders
 *     nothing yet.
