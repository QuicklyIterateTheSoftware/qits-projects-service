/**
 * The per-project agent container's lifecycle: ensure it is up, stop it, read what it is doing.
 *
 * <p>Three routes and one response shape, deliberately. The panel that drives this has exactly one
 * question — "can I talk to the agent yet?" — and answering it the same way from all three keeps
 * the client's state machine to one branch: it renders {@code container.runtimeStatus} and, when
 * that is {@code RUNNING}, opens its terminal through {@code /projects/container/{projectId}/…}.
 *
 * <p>The two halves of the answer are independent on purpose. {@code runtimeStatus} is docker's
 * view; {@code daemonConnected} is whether the process inside has dialled home. A container can be
 * {@code RUNNING} with no daemon connected for the seconds between {@code docker start} and the
 * first {@code Hello}, and the client shows "starting" rather than a broken terminal.
 *
 * <p><b>A container whose provision failed is {@code FAILED}, not {@code RUNNING}.</b> The daemon
 * clones the project into {@code /workspace} on boot; when that fails the container stays up and
 * docker calls it healthy, so the honest answer comes from what the daemon said rather than from
 * what docker sees. {@code failureDetail} carries the reason, and it is what the panel shows
 * instead of a terminal onto an empty checkout.
 *
 * <p>Everything below the surface is in {@code agenthost/}. This class only names the routes.
