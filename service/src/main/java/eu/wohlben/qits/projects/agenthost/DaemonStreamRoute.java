/**
 * Where a daemon's dial-back lands: {@code /projects/daemon/stream/{nonce}}. The nonce names a TCP
 * connection {@link AgentTunnels} parked when the proxy opened one, and this route marries the two
 * into a byte pipe. Adapted verbatim from qits-workspaces' {@code DaemonStreamRoute}.
 *
 * <h2>A raw Vert.x route, not websockets-next</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code io.quarkus.websockets.next.Connection} exposes {@code sendBinary(Buffer) → Uni} and
 * nothing else — no {@code writeQueueFull}, no {@code drainHandler}. A byte tunnel without a
 * backpressure signal is an unbounded heap buffer, so the framework's own socket abstraction is the
 * one thing this cannot be built on. {@code request.toWebSocket()} yields a {@link ServerWebSocket},
 * which is a proper {@code WriteStream} and makes both ends of the pipe the same types.
 *
 * <p>It shares a prefix with {@link AgentControlSocket}'s {@code /projects/daemon/{projectId}} and
 * does not collide: {@code {projectId}} matches exactly one segment, so no project can be named
 * {@code stream}. This route is registered ahead of the framework's own so the two never race.
 *
 * <h2>The nonce is the whole authentication</h2>
 *
 * <p>Deliberately, and it is not the shared API token by another name. The control socket names its
 * caller with a path parameter, so anything on {@code qits-net} can claim to be any project's
 * daemon; a dial-back that named its own project would reproduce that in a second place. This one
 * names nothing: it is host-minted, single-use (the claim is an atomic map removal), short-lived,
 * and bound to the project it was sent to. An unknown or already-claimed nonce gets a bare 404 that
 * says nothing about which of the two it was.
 *
 * <h2>And a bearer, since the front desks (qits-767)</h2>
 *
 * <p>A desk runs on a runner's node and dials back through the edge, which refuses an anonymous
 * upgrade, so it sends {@code Authorization: Bearer $QITS_TOKEN} and the edge forwards a JWT. The
 * dial-back now <b>requires an authenticated caller</b>, and a {@code tok-} subject must be the
 * nonce's project's {@code front_desk.token_subject}; the nonce stays the second factor. Anything
 * else gets the same bare 404 an unknown nonce gets, and the parked connection is dropped.
