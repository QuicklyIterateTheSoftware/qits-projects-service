/**
 * qits-ci said a run finished — green or red — so the per-commit build-status ledger gains a row.
 *
 * <p>The consuming half of the release-quality-gates foundation: {@link BuildStatusLedger} is what
 * a release request's build gate will read, and later this same consumption is where a pending gate
 * resolves — event arrives, ledger row written, matching gates re-evaluated, one consumer in one
 * service. That coupling is the reason the ledger is here and not in the git host.
 *
 * <p><b>The signatures are strings and the payload is a local record</b>, the {@code
 * qits-deployments} subscriber's shape rather than the githost-events one: qits-ci publishes no
 * consumed vocabulary jar this service already holds, and the payload is a handful of strings on a
 * wire. The cost — a rename over there is silent here — is the cost every cross-repo event contract
 * carries, and the listener test pins both names as literals so a change at least has to be a diff.
 *
 * <p><b>The phase word rides these two events now, and this listener deliberately ignores it.</b>
 * Since 2026-09-16 {@code BuildSuccessful}, {@code BuildFailed} and {@code BuildStatusChanged} all
 * carry {@code phase} — {@code RELEASE_REQUEST} or {@code RELEASE}, absent for the ordinary run —
 * saying which phase of a release the run was. Nothing about a <em>verdict about a commit</em>
 * changes because of it: the ledger's rows are what the release gate reads and the gate does not
 * care which pipeline produced the green. The phase is mirrored by {@link
 * ReleasePipelineRunListener} off the third event, where every transition arrives rather than only
 * the terminal one, and that is the listener to add a field to if this service ever needs the word.
 * Binding it here would put the same fact in two tables with two writers.
 *
 * <p><b>What never arrives is part of the contract:</b> qits-ci announces terminal runs only, and
 * neither cancelled nor deduped-superseded ones — so every row written here is a genuine verdict
 * about a commit, and a commit with rows for every run and no failures among them is what the build
 * gate will read as green.
 *
 * <h2>Failure</h2>
 *
 * <p>The seam's rule: a throw rolls the claim back and the event is owed forever, so swallow what
 * retrying cannot fix and throw what it can. A payload that will not parse or names no {@code
 * (runId, repoId, commitSha)} is poison — WARN and return. A database that could not answer is left
 * to throw, because the next attempt is exactly what fixes it.
