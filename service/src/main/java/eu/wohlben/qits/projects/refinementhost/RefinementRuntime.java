/**
 * The container verbs the refinement lifecycle needs, as a seam — the refinement twin of
 * {@code agenthost/ContainerRuntime}, and like it a port so the suite can install a fake and reach
 * no orchestrator. The sole implementation is {@code containershost/ContainersRefinementRuntime}.
 *
 * <p><b>The place is {@code owner/refinement/<rowId>}.</b> The row id is minted by this database,
 * is unique forever, and is already a legal orchestrator ref — so unlike qits-workspaces there is
 * no name-derived ref and no hash disambiguator to need: the container <em>name</em>
 * ({@code qits-ref-<projectSlug>-<slug>}) is a {@code docker ps} hint carried as
 * {@code explicitName}, never an address. What a human-derived name can still do is collide, and
 * the provisioning arm answers that with a 409 rather than a constraint 500.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the agent runtime this one has a removal verb: a refinement is discarded when its epic
 * leaves refinement, and the teardown order — container first, then volume — is the wire contract.
