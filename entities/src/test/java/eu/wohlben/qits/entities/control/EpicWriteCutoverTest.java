/**
 * An epics <b>write</b> holds through a postgres cutover, and lands exactly once when it does.
 *
 * <p>One seam stands for the ten wrapped in this module ({@code EpicService}'s four, {@code
 * FeatureService}'s three, {@code TaskService}'s three): they share {@link WritePatience}, so what
 * this pins is the wiring — {@code DbRetry.inNewTx} opens the transaction, a body failure that says
 * the connection went is retried, and everything else is reported on the first attempt.
 *
 * <p><b>Exactly once is the assertion that matters.</b> A retry is only worth having if a write that
 * was interrupted after being staged leaves one row and not two, and {@link FailingEpicWrites} fails
 * after {@code persist} precisely so that question has an answer. The count is read in a fresh
 * transaction, because this test calls the service on one thread with no request scope and a
 * thread-bound session would answer from its own cache.
 *
 * <p><b>The other half is the one that must NOT retry.</b> A constraint violation is as certain not
 * to have committed as a lost connection is, and as certain to fail the same way for fifteen
 * seconds; retrying it would turn one visible failure into a slow one. The proof is the attempt
 * count, not the clock: five failures armed, four still unspent.
 *
 * <p><b>The count is read from {@code entity} rather than from the legacy {@code epic} table, and
 * that is the one assertion the mirror's removal moved.</b> It used to go through {@code
 * EpicRepository}, which answered because {@code EpicService} wrote a legacy row behind every
 * create; with the mirror gone that table has no writer at all and the same query answers zero for
 * every case here — a green-looking nothing rather than a failure, which is why the subject had to
 * move rather than the number. The claim is unchanged: exactly one epic row, counted in the table
 * the create actually writes.
