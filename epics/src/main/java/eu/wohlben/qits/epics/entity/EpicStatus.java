 * The phase an {@link Archetype#EPIC} entity is in. Stored as the enum name (V3) in {@link
 * WorkEntity#status}, and the only thing that decides
 * which mutations the services accept — see {@code EpicLifecycle}.
 *
 * <p>"Done" used to be derived only — {@link #IMPLEMENTATION} with every feature's {@code
 * implementedOn} set — and deliberately not stored, so the same fact could not have two sources
 * that disagree. {@link #IMPLEMENTED} stores it now, and answers that objection at the transition
 * instead: the move stamps every unimplemented feature and task in the same transaction, so the
 * stored status and the derived reading agree the moment either exists. What forced the change is
 * the epic with no features at all — implemented directly from its description, with nothing for
 * the derivation to fire on, it sat in IMPLEMENTATION forever with no way to say it had shipped.
