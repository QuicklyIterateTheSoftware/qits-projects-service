/**
 * The planning spine (one per docs-epic today), owned by a project. {@code projectId} references
 * {@code domain}'s {@code Project} by String id — no JPA {@code @ManyToOne} and no cross-DB FK
 * (epics is a separate physical DB); existence is validated in the {@code service} controller.
 *
 * <p><b>A {@link CausedRow}.</b> Epics are minted by agents as much as by people: {@code
 * EpicMcpTools.createEpic} is the same {@code EpicService.create} the SPA reaches, on the same
 * request thread, so the {@code CausationStamp} listener reads the scope the {@code
 * X-Qits-Causation-Id} filter restored and the row records what asked for this epic. A person
 * typing into the SPA sends no header and leaves a rootless row, which is the correct answer rather
 * than a missing one.
 *
 * <p>The {@link AuditEntry} written beside every change is a {@code CausedRow} too, and the two are
 * not the same fact: this column answers "what caused this epic to exist", insert-only and forever;
 * the audit log answers the same question for every later update and for the delete, after this row
 * is gone.
